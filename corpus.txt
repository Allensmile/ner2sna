{"0": "President Donald Trump has created an \u201cOffice of American Innovation\u201d and an \u201cAmerican Technology Council\u201d to promote an America First economic policy. The head of the Council, Jared Kushner, hosted an event at the White House last month to promote technology week. Among the invited companies was one that did not fit in \u2013 the German tech company SAP.\n\nOn the official White House issues page on the website titled \u201cBring Back Jobs and Growth\u201d it states the following: \u201cWe will ensure that trade agreements bring good-paying jobs to our shores and support American manufacturing, the backbone of our economy. The President plans to show America\u2019s trading partners that we mean business by ensuring consequences for countries that engage in illegal or unfair trade practices that hurt American workers.\u201d Keeping jobs in the United States and not outsourcing jobs to foreign companies is part of President Trump\u2019s economic plan. That is why the inclusion of SAP was a head scratcher.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis White House Innovation Council is pushing for American innovation and technology. Some of the most successful foreign tech companies like Deutsche Telecom, Europe\u2019s largest internet provider, wasn\u2019t invited. Alibaba, China\u2019s most popular e-commerce site, and Amazon and eBay\u2019s largest competitor, was off the invite list too. Yandex, the Google of Russia, is another successful multinational corporation that was not invited. All of these companies are at least as successful, yet it was obvious that they were not proper invitees to a summit sponsored by the American Technology Council. For some unknown reason, the CEO of SAP, was not only in attendance, but he was lecturing White House officials on the need to outsource management software purchases to this German company.\n\nSAP is a company that provides software for business management and customer relations. USA Today reported that the CEO Bill McDermott attended the summit and his company put out a statement that read that the company \u201csupports the stated goals of the American Technology Council and its efforts to transform and modernize the federal government, and innovate how agencies use and deliver information.\u201d Other reports indicated that SAP pitched the summit on the U.S. government using the German produced software for government services.\n\nThe summit served a very important purpose because the U.S. government is living in the dark ages when it comes to use of technology. President Trump spoke of a \u201csweeping transformation\u201d in the federal government\u2019s use of technology. Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook argued that \u201cthe U.S. should have the most modern government in the world and today it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s great to see the effort that Jared is putting in in working on things that will pay back in five and 10 and 20 years.\u201d That transformation should be with technology from Google, Microsoft, Apple and Oracle, not outsources to foreign competitors like Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telecom, China\u2019s Alibaba, Russia\u2019s Yandex and SAP.\n\nProtectionism is something that the tech community would like to avoid. It will lead to a trade war and other nations preventing American companies from providing technology and services abroad. A trade war would lead to countries walling off their economies from the world in a way where everybody would lose. That is an extreme way to push an America first economic policy.\n\nYet, another extreme idea is to use taxpayer money to purchase the services of a company wholly owned outside the United States with comparable technology made in America. The idea that the United States government would purchase the services of a foreign company when an American company does the identical function seems absurd.\n\nThe White House probably made a mistake in inviting a German technology provider to come to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d White House technology summit. Hopefully, as the White House offices of American Innovation and American technology don\u2019t outsource invitations to the next summit for other foreign companies."}

For more than two centuries, those three beautiful words have been the world standard for quality, craftsmanship and excellence \u2013 and they still are today.\n\nAs President, one of my highest priorities is to restore American Manufacturing. For decades, American jobs have been ripped out of our communities, industries and towns have been stripped bare, and the entire communities have been uprooted and left. Foreign nations got rich at America\u2019s expense \u2013 and many special interests profited from this great global theft of American wealth.\n\nSince taking the oath of office, our government has adopted a new philosophy: AMERICA FIRST \u2013 and believe me, it\u2019s about time. The era of economic surrender is over \u2013 and a new national pride is sweeping across our land. You see it, I see it, we all see it.\n\nIndustry confidence has soared to the highest level ever recorded.\n\nOne of my first acts was ordering all federal agencies to enforce two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. We want to build with American Workers, and with American Iron, Aluminum and Steel.\n\nWe are also tearing down every possible barrier to domestic energy production to unleash the full power of our economy. The American people will finally be allowed to tap into the vast energy wealth sitting right beneath our feet or right below our shores.\n\nWe have also sent a clear message to the world that we will not allow other nations to take advantage of us any longer.\n\nThat\u2019s why I withdrew from the one-sided Paris Climate Accord \u2013 and believe me, it was one-sided. Not a good deal for our country. And the job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership, and that\u2019s why we are pursuing a total renegotiation of NAFTA and if we don\u2019t get it, we will terminate \u2013 that is end NAFTA forever.\n\nEvery other nation on earth protects its own interests. America is finally going to do the same.\n\nAnd as we continue to fight for American workers and industry, it won\u2019t be long before we see the Made in America label proudly displayed on thousands of new products all across this great land and exported all around the world.\n\nThank you, God bless you, God bless America. We are all doing a job, we are working very hard. It will be America First. It will be Make America Great Again. It\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"}

Reps for Trump Jr. and Kushner confirmed the meeting to the Times but described it as primarily about an adoption program.\n\nThe lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, has reportedly been fighting the Magnitsky Act \u2014 an American law that blacklists Russian human rights abusers and triggered Russian President Vladimir Putin to halt American adoptions of Russian children.\n\nIn a statement to the Times, Trump Jr. said the \u201cshort\u201d meeting involved discussion of \u201ca program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.\u201d\n\nCirca also reported that the meeting was short, lasting only 20 minutes. The outlet also reported that the president\u2019s legal team believe the meeting may have been part of an election-year opposition effort to create the appearance of \u201cimproper connections\u201d between Trump and Russia.\n\nMark Corallo, a spokesman for President Trump\u2019s legal team, told Circa:\n\nWe have learned from both our own investigation and public reports that the participants in the meeting misrepresented who they were and who they worked for. Specifically, we have learned that the person who sought the meeting is associated with Fusion GPS, a firm which according to public reports, was retained by Democratic operatives to develop opposition research on the President and which commissioned the phony Steele dossier.\n\n\u201cThese developments raise serious issues as to exactly who authorized and participated in any effort by Russian nationals to influence our election in any manner,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Times reports that the meeting was not disclosed until recently, when Kushner filed a revised version of a form to obtain a security clearance. Kushner\u2019s advisers described the omission as an error.\n\nKushner\u2019s lawyer told the Times in a statement.:\n\nHe has since submitted this information, including that during the campaign and transition, he had over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries, most of which were during transition. Mr. Kushner has submitted additional updates and included, out of an abundance of caution, this meeting with a Russian person, which he briefly attended at the request of his brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr. As Mr. Kushner has consistently stated, he is eager to cooperate and share what he knows.\n\nThe Times notes that Trump Jr. does not have to disclose foreign contacts as he does not serve in the administration, nor does he have a security clearance. The story claims that the lawyer is a \u201cformidable operator with a history of pushing the Kremlin\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nAdam Shaw is a Breitbart News politics reporter based in New York.

But over the years, accidents and vandalism have wiped out most of the signs, with just one remaining now near San Ysidro.\n\nThe signs were installed after more than 100 people were killed trying to cross the freeway in the 1980s. In 1986, illegal crossings in the San Diego sector reached an all-time high, with 628,000 apprehensions, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. According to the Los Angeles Times, the area \u2014 geographically the smallest for Border Patrol \u2014 was once the busiest sector for illegal immigration in the U.S., accounting for more than 40 percent of nationwide apprehensions in the early \u201990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, federal officials decided to erect a wall between the U.S. and Mexico in the San Diego area and as a result, illegal crossings migrated east to Arizona and Texas. By 2016 Border Patrol agents apprehended 31,891 people in the San Diego sector suspected of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nBut in the 1980s the freeway crossings were a real danger to both the drivers and illegals trying to evade Border Patrol. In the Camp Pendleton area of the 5 Freeway, oftentimes human smugglers would order the illegals they were shuttling to cross 8-10 lanes of high-speed freeway traffic to get to the beachside and proceed on foot until they were past the checkpoint. More than a few occasions, the illegals would be run over by speeding and unsuspecting drivers right in front of their family members.\n\nCaltrans then decided to replace the ineffective text signs that read \u201cCaution: Watch for People Crossing Road,\u201d and enlisted its graphic artist John Hood to design a new sign. A Vietnam vet who grew up in a Navajo reservation, Hood drew on his experience from the war as well as stories his parents told him about the Navajo flight and came up a sign that conveyed both urgency and fear.\n\nThe new signs immediately drew lots of attention as well as criticism. Some Latino activists deemed the faceless silhouettes racist. Anti-illegal immigration advocates thought the state should not spend money to protect people who were breaking the law. But entrepreneurs loved it. Since the image remained public property and no one had to pay Caltrans for its use, souvenirs featuring a variation of the \u201crunning immigrants\u201d propped up all over Southern California on T-shirts, stickers, and flags.\n\n\u201cYou create your work, and that\u2019s the extent of it. You never envision something like that to happen,\u201d Hood to the Times about the sign\u2019s evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s become an iconic element. It lives on.\u201d"}

Trump to meet with Vladimir V. Putin, President of Russia.\n\nThe scheduled meeting was to be a meaningless icebreaker, get to know you session, lasting some thirty minutes.

Globalization was their stated enemy when it should have been globalism. Who funds all these wackos anyway; as they always show up again and again, accomplish nothing, except attempted disruption and continual news coverage, as if they were the story?\n\nThere were four myths that the media had projected around this first meeting between the Presidents, Trump and Putin, each of which needs to be defused and put to rest. They are all liberal gibberish:\n\n# 1 Myth is that the US and Russia are equals. The facts portray the true reality. The US economy is 20x times larger than that of Russias; and Russia is in decline as a still emerging economy, entirely dependent on the (low and getting lower) price of oil & gas. The US military spends $600 billion a year and the Russians spend only $67 billion. They are no match on the land, in the air, or at sea, except for one category: nuclear weapons. When it comes to cultural influence there simply is NO comparison.\n\n# 2 Myth is that the Americans hate Russians and vice versa. This is simply not true. We have in the past been allies, foes, and frememies and the fact that Russia deals in destabilizing measures is nothing new. As if America doesn\u2019t? This meeting disappointed the CNN crowd, as it was not the movie, Rocky IV, where Rocky Balboa took a wicked beating from Captain Ivan Drago until the last round. Russia and America it appears, surprise, surprise, can get along, can work together, can relate and even agree. Someone needs to tell all the costly and duplicative committees in the US Congress investigating\u2014who knows what?\n\n# 3 Myth international relations is not , regardless what the G20 or the UN, or god forbid, the EU says\u2014all about cooperation and a collaboration of multipolar weak powers to achieve next to nothing. In fact, Thucydides got it right centuries BC, when he stated: \u201cThe strong do what they can do and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d Life may no longer be quite the Hobbesian: short, nasty and brutish but it takes realpolitik and real leadership to get things done\u2014in war and peace. Trump and Putin seem to get that where other so-called \u2018world leaders\u2019 and the weak institutions they create \u2014 don\u2019t.\n\n# 4 Myth is simply that culture matters. Trump and Team America have read Russian culture. In the classic, Icon & The Axe, former Librarian of Congress, James Billington, argued that you can\u2019t understand Russia without knowing its history, literature, and culture, which is rooted in long suffering and the strong division between Europe and Asia. The Russian psyche is one of near constant lament and doom. Trump read this and allowed Putin a way to save face, be on a grand stage and solve world problems (many of which were indeed caused by Russia itself). He respected, perhaps, used Putin\u2014who we were warned beforehand was the dangerous, all too clever spymaster and brilliant chess player \u2014 to his own aims. In the end, it was Putin who got played.\n\nCan we finally get on now with treating Russia as a valuable nation state who has interests, some of which correspond with our own, some not, and start to deal with them as a player?\n\nPutin and Trump don\u2019t have to be best buds and a bromance was never really in the cards \u2014 only in the minds of the sorry, losing party and its media pawns. But as Henry Kissinger reminded us just weeks ago, \u201cDonald Trump is right about Russia\u2026 I hope that an effort will be made for a serious dialogue which tries to avoid the drift towards confrontation.\u201d\n\nYou see, Russia remains and always will be a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, as Churchill famously called it in 1939. But as he shrewdly went on to say, \u201cPerhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.\u201d\n\nTrump has put America first but also realized that Russia needs to have air to breathe and scope to maneuver. It has a role in the game even if it is not quite yet welcomed into the Western civilized \u2018community of nations\u2019. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t call them out as he clearly did in Poland, or undercut them when it comes to providing alternative energy options to eastern and central Europe. It only means they can be useful when and where our interests intersect. No more, no less. And like the greatest diplomat to deal with the then Russian (Soviet) nemesis, Ronald Reagan insisted: \u2018trust but verify\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the following rounds in this US-Russia match can build on what was surely a solid start, reestablish a modicum of respect for each other and our duly elected leaders, and continue to debunk all four myths.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Malloch is a diplomat and scholar whose memoir is entitled, DAVOS, ASPEN & YALE: My Life Behind the Elite Curtain as a Global Sherpa."}

He\u2019s more of a fantasist and a fairy-tale writer than a reporter,\u201d he said.\n\nIn an article published in May last year, Piatek made a number of remarks about Tyrmand \u2013 who has previously written for Breitbart News \u2014 which the 36-year-old believes were malicious lies published purposely to defame his character as retaliation for an article he wrote only nine days earlier, exploring potential George Soros links with KOD \u2013 the Committee for Defence of Democracy [Komitet Obrony Demokracji].\n\nTyrmand said: \u201cThis was very much a response to James O\u2019Keefe [founder of Project Veritas] and my investigation into Soros and KOD. There\u2019s no coincidence in terms of timing, and the timing was such that we did this investigation, we put it out there on Breitbart and elsewhere, I did a bunch of Polish media around it and then a Soros-backed outfit was at the same time funding Gazeta Wyborcza.\n\n\u201cAgora [which Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations recently took a large stake in] went in and bailed them out because the last government was doing so through PZU [a state owned insurance company] but with the electoral shift in power, that was no longer viable.\n\n\u201cSo MDIF [Media Development Investment Fund] comes in as a philanthropic entity that invests where \u2018free press is under assault,\u2019 which is obviously nonsense in Poland.\n\n\u201cHe comes in, and shortly after, Piatek writes a hit-piece filled with lies saying that I was on Trump\u2019s payroll and by extension that I was a [Vladimir] Putin shill. All this happens at the same time. Incidentally, during that time Gazeta Wyborcza is putting in inserts to fund KOD.\u201d\n\nWhen Tyrmand saw Piatek\u2019s article he believed he had a strong case against the newspaper.\n\n\u201cWhen the piece came out I reacted immediately on social media and thought, \u2018this is unconscionable.\u2019 I called my lawyers and said \u2018how far beyond the line is this?\u2019 I thought it was [beyond the line] because not only were these lies, but they were really easily verifiably lies,\u201d he said.\n\nPiatek wrote about Tyrmand again last November, this time responding to being sued by the Polish-Jewish-American writer. He suggested Tyrmand\u2019s lack of Polish language skills meant he probably didn\u2019t read his article and that his lawyers should have explained to him that he was wrong.\n\nTyrmand said: \u201cHe blamed my lawyers, which is amazing. They\u2019re the best lawyers in Poland on IP [intellectual property].\n\n\u201cThese lawyers play at the highest level and yet he makes that smear, saying that I didn\u2019t understand what he was saying. Everybody understood what he was saying and that was a cop out, and it was a weak cop out, to try and remove his own culpability and shift it.\u201d\n\nPiatek also told Associated Press he found it suspicious Tyrmand had waited until July to start proceedings against him, after he had published another article criticising Polish Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz, a claim Tyrmand finds laughable.\n\n\u201cIt took me a few weeks to go through the fact patterns with my lawyers,\u201d he explained.\n\nThe son of the popular late anti-Communist novelist, writer and editor Leopold Tyrmand, has written for Breitbart London on the health of Polish democracy after the election of the Law and Justice Party, and how Poland is one of the best places for Jews to live; neither of which are in tune with Gazeta Wyborcza\u2019s narratives. He has also not been afraid to criticise the paper in previous articles.\n\nTyrmand said: \u201cI am an existential threat to them because I have the ability to go, not just in Poland where they are pretty well-hated and understood, but all over the world to talk about what they do and what they represent.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising that this piece especially, because it hit close to home with the investigation into Soros and KOD, who they are aligned with, meant that they pulled out all the stops in going after me.\u201d\n\nTyrmand\u2019s colleague James O\u2019Keefe, who Piatek referred to in his piece as a \u2018specialist in illegal recordings and eavesdropping,\u2019 was the first to take the witness stand on Wednesday, June 21.\n\n\u201cJames O\u2019Keefe coming to testify was really great, because here\u2019s a really high-profile crusader for journalistic truth and transparency in media,\u201d Tyrmand said.\n\n\u201cHim coming to Poland really helped establish the credibility of the argument as well as give it huge visibility, given his visibility,\u201d he added.\n\nIf he wins, Tyrmand wants an apology and 50,000 Polish zlotys which he intends to donate to five Polish charities. He also wants corrections to be made to the article.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for them to strike the column. I\u2019d like the column to remain up but with highlights on each of the ten or dozen or so lies that I pinpointed, clarifying that they were not honest and giving the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next court session takes place in November, where Tyrmand said will call more witnesses to the stand to testify on his behalf."}
{"20": "#CNNBlackmail is the best thing to have happened to the world since the election of Donald Trump. Indeed, it may be one of the greatest moments in the history of the internet.\n\nSure, on one level it resulted in weapons-grade trolling and a few deliciously funny memes; but in bigger picture terms it was something much more significant than that \u2013 a pivotal moment in the Culture Wars akin to the Persian defeat at Salamis or the German defeat at Stalingrad or the French defeat at Trafalgar.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOr maybe a better analogy would be the one I used on Sirius XM: the moment during the Second World War when, under the command of the brilliant Bill Slim, the ill-equipped, neglected British Fourteenth Army realized that the only way to beat the Japanese was to fight with the same aggression, cunning, and mobility of the Japanese. In other words, to use the enemy\u2019s tactics against them.\n\nJust like CNN, just like Antifa, just like the left generally, the Japanese were a horrible enemy to fight: utterly without scruples, fanatically convinced of the justice of their wicked cause, terrifying in the swiftness with which they swarmed and overran your position. By the time you knew what had hit you, you\u2019d either be dead \u2014 if you were lucky \u2014 or tied, wounded, to a tree while the enemy got ready to use you for bayonet practice.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, the British and their fellow Allies were invariably on the back foot: how could they possibly defeat an enemy that didn\u2019t play by the rules, that showed no weakness, that seemed more demonic than human?\n\nAnyone who has ever seen action against the SJWs will know the feeling.\n\nThey hunt in packs; they swarm; they move as one as if controlled by some sinister hive mind; they are immune to reason; they are completely without mercy.\n\nI give you, as but one example among many, the case of poor Sir Tim Hunt \u2014 the Nobel-prize-winning scientist whose career was all but destroyed for no better reason than the SJW hive mind demanded fresh blood.\n\nThe truth (that Hunt was the victim of outrageous misreporting by a dodgy hack pursuing a militant feminist agenda) was no defense. Nor were any mitigating circumstances taken into account \u2014 like, say, the fact that this alleged sexist Prof ha, in fact, spent his entire career bending over backward to help and encourage female scientists. Nor was the fact that he apologized for his non-crime.\n\nAll that mattered as far as the SJWs were concerned was that here was another scalp for the taking. So take it they did.\n\nTo experience these terror tactics is a demoralizing and frightening thing.\n\nToo often the response of the right has been to feel a bit sorry for itself because it\u2019s all so unfair. And then persuade itself that if only it keeps on making the same arguments as before then eventually logic and truth will prevail because, after all, the facts of life are conservative.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one major problem with this response: the left isn\u2019t interested in logic and facts \u2014 and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time.\n\nThat was what James O\u2019Keefe recently uncovered \u2014 not that we couldn\u2019t have guessed anyway \u2014 with his recent sting on CNN. Here is an organization which affects the demeanor of a responsible, politically-neutral, internationally-respected news outlet with reporters and newscasters who look exactly like real ones on grown up TV channels. But underneath, its entire raison d\u2019etre and business model is churning out leftist fake news propaganda.\n\nIf conservative media outlets like Breitbart took the same liberties with the truth as leftist media outlets like CNN (and Vox and Slate and Salon and Huffpost and the rest\u2026) they would be crucified. But it\u2019s no use bleating about this: we just have to accept that this is the way the world works and just get on with the business of winning.\n\n#CNNBlackmail, make no mistake, was a pivotal #winning moment.\n\nWhy and how did we win? Partly by using the enemy\u2019s tactics against them; partly by exploiting a few strengths of our own.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\n\u201cSorry. Not interested\u201d\n\nBeing on the left is all about grievance, victimhood and \u2014 usually feigned \u2014 moral outrage. This was the card CNN tried playing in response to the original Trump wrestling gif. They invited us to believe that Trump\u2019s tweet encouraged \u201cviolence against reporters.\u201d We responded in the best way possible: by ignoring it. This may have been what infuriated CNN into making their massive tactical error of hunting down and trying to destroy the alleged creator of the gif. Had CNN shrugged its shoulders and ignored the wrestler gif, it would not be writhing in such abject humiliation now.\n\nJokes\n\nThe left has lots of comedians, but it can\u2019t do jokes: look at John Oliver, who, despite his lucrative gift of being able to persuade liberal studio audiences to make laugh-type noises, has never said anything genuinely funny in his life. This is because progressives are ideologically incapable of humor. We discuss this in more detail on my Delingpole podcast next week on a Special Youth Edition featuring a clever 18-year-old kid who understands the internet and memes and stuff. The reason the right is winning the internet war, he explains, is because our memes are much wittier than their memes. And the reason for that is that the left can\u2019t do humor because they\u2019re afraid it might hurt someone\u2019s feelings.\n\nPoint And Swarm; Isolate And Shriek\n\nAs Vox Day explains in his invaluable SJW Attack Survival Guide, these are classic techniques used by the regressive left. Now the tables have been turned, and we are learning to use their methods against them. CNN got so panicked after the backlash hit, it had to ban all its staff from using Twitter because whatever they did or said only seemed to make things worse. SJWs can dish it, but they really can\u2019t take it.\n\nAdvertisers\n\nAnother of the left\u2019s favorite dirty tricks is to target companies that advertise with conservative media organizations \u2014 and bully them into withdrawing their funding (see Kellogg\u2019s v Breitbart). On the right, we have traditionally been against such tactics because what you\u2019re essentially doing is fighting against two of the things we believe in \u2014 free markets and free speech. The tables were turned when advertisers including Audi (another company, incidentally, which withdrew its advertising from Breitbart) were attacked by outraged punters demanding to know why they fund a company as toxic as CNN.\n\nGive Them Enough Rope\u2026\n\nCNN is ISIS. It\u2019s a joke but it\u2019s also true: CNN is very much part of the axis of evil bent on destroying Western Civilization. We should never forget this \u2014 nor delude ourselves just because this particular battle involves frivolous stuff like memes of old martial arts video game characters with Trump\u2019s head and the CNN logo superimposed on them that somehow it isn\u2019t really important. I\u2019m with Thomas Wictor on this one:\n\n(1) Did I call it or what? #CNNBlackmail The mainstream media now sees itself as internal state security. pic.twitter.com/UnPZww7UwJ \u2014 Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) July 5, 2017\n\n(2) When journalists use their powers to dictate WHAT YOU WILL SAY, that means the press is now a secret police. \u2014 Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) July 5, 2017\n\nThat attack by CNN\u2019s sinister enforcer Andrew Kaczynski on Reddit user HanAssholeSolo was an outrageous act of overreach by the increasingly aggressive and hectoring left. It was the liberal media deciding that among its new roles is to police society\u2019s behavior and mores in the manner of the NKVD.\n\nDefinitely one good thing to have come out of #CNNBlackmail is that the enemy has shown its true colors. But the far, far better news is that the good guys have fought back.\n\nAnd the best news of all is: we\u2019re #winning."}

The 85th Texas Legislature authorized the program to provide the higher level of protection to officers in the wake of five Dallas-area officers being gunned down at the end of a Black Lives Matter protest on July 7, 2016.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe bill, authored by State Senator Royce West (D-Dallas) and State Rep.

{"22": "It may as well have been written before President Trump even uttered a single word in Warsaw earlier this week, the Economist\u2018s panicked, hysterical, and un-bylined reflection on his speech that placed matters of identity, culture, faith and sovereignty over democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Warsaw, America\u2019s president barely mentions democracy,\u201d the article\u2019s sub-headline shrieks. For a magazine so fervently opposed to the results of the Brexit referendum (direct democracy in action), you could easily hurl accusations of hypocrisy at the magazine\u2019s editors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInstead, we should be more wary of the ongoing fetishisation of the idea of one-man-one-vote as some kind of be all and end all of Western civilization.\n\nFirstly, in the grand scheme of all things European \u2014 and derivative nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia, etc \u2014 democracy is a relatively new concept. The cynic may well drop in this overused Churchill quote. Or this one. Again, too easy.\n\nIt strikes me as more important that we look at what the Economist is trying to achieve by declaring:\n\nWhen George W. Bush visited Poland for his first presidential visit, in 2001, he referred to democracy 13 times. When Barack Obama spoke in Warsaw in 2014, he mentioned democracy nine times. For Mr Trump, once sufficed.\n\nThe tone conveys hostility, not just towards those who do not believe the West is typified by more than the ballot box, but also to those who believe history matters, tradition matters, nation states matter, and identity matters.\n\nA refusal to deify democracy runs deeply contrary to the objectives of globalism, which explains the Economist\u2019s petulance.\n\nFor decades we have watched, almost stunned into inaction, as our children are forced to learn that patriotism is racist, and history is to be altered at the whim of the loudest, shrieking, protesters.\n\nMine isn\u2019t an anti-democracy argument either. Merely I want to reflect upon how the President struck the right balance between democracy and philosophy/history in his Warsaw speech.\n\nBut The Economist wants to give ahistorical progressivism \u2014 a tool often leveraged, even if not adhered to, by globalists \u2014 an intellectual underpinning. But there is no intelligence in this mantra. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe notion of putting democracy on a higher pedestal than tradition is anti-intellectual.\n\nConservatives and reactionaries are, today, less likely to be motivated by fear and emotion and more interested in learning lessons from the past that the left would rather ignore or rewrite.\n\nMany mistake the Economist for a pro-free market capitalist paper. Untrue.\n\nIt favours corporatism and cronyism. It isn\u2019t left or right per se. But it does favour the modern political centre-left, more interested in \u201cinternationalism\u201d, more in favour of the political establishment than the everyman. Hence its risible backing of the pro-European Union Liberal Democrats at the British general election.\n\nCurious, you might think then, that the magazine would side with the demos who elected President Donald J. Trump. Not so, either.\n\nPresident Trump won because of the electoral college, a check on a more direct democracy, and one which the Economist has previously sought to undermine in its U.S.-election coverage. Heaven forfend we suggest a return to the Senate\u2019s original role in not being a directly elected chamber either. That could really set their heads spinning.\n\nIt would be unfair however to state the paper misunderstands the idea of the tyranny of the majority. There have previously been printed warnings over referendums or ballot measures in the United States on their own pages. So what has changed since then, when in 2011, they published the following words:\n\n\u2026it is the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d that James Madison, a Founding Father, warned about. His reading of ancient history was that the direct democracy of Athens was erratic and short-lived, whereas republican Rome remained stable for much longer. He even worried about using the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d at all, lest citizens confuse its representative (ie, republican) form with its direct one. \u201cDemocracy never lasts long,\u201d wrote John Adams, another Founding Father. Asked what government the federal constitution of 1787 had established, Benjamin Franklin responded: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d\n\nIn a word: Trump.\n\nIn another word: populism.\n\nThough JFK, Obama, and other centre-left politicians were swept into power on a populist wave, they represented the Wilsonian internationalism the Economist prefers. So they were okay. The same internationalism that loves democracy promotion abroad which led to the quagmire of the Iraq War: the reason we weren\u2019t able to stablise Iraq post-invasion. Our newfound obsession with putting a tick in a box.\n\nAgain, no grasp or reflection of this from the Economist as it lambasts the President of the United States for focusing on political philosophy rather than fawning over a system of electing a government.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t imagine editorialising such as: \u201cThe spectators, mainly conservative Catholics bused in from around the country and promised a free picnic at the defence ministry afterwards\u201d under an Obama presidency. In fact, these are the same tactics the left uses at elections as well as for protests and marches all around the Western world.\n\nOnce more, hypocritically, the paper takes a dig at the recently democratically elected Polish government:\n\nBut the greatest reason for Poland\u2019s government to be delighted with Mr Trump was what he did not mention: PiS\u2019s undermining of democratic institutions to entrench its own power. The party has stuffed the civil service and the diplomatic corps with loyalists and has weakened the independence of the judiciary. It has transformed the national broadcaster into a mouthpiece of the state. Independent journalists face new restrictions. The European Commission has warned the government that its reforms pose \u201ca systemic risk to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nOf course the (unelected, by the way) European Commission has said that. PiS has been steadfast in protecting Poland from the EU\u2019s migration madness, as well as taking steps to reassert Polish sovereignty.\n\nNever has the Economist mentioned how during the years the pro-establishment Civic Platform ruled, they too \u201cstuffed the civil service and diplomatic corps with loyalists\u201d. Their looting is one of the major reasons they lost to PiS in 2015.\n\nThe Economist wants to bash PiS and Trump; facts, philosophy, and even their own commitment to democracy be damned. If that means humiliating itself by performing anti-intellectual mid-air back flips in the process, it seems the editors are more than willing to do so.\n\nRaheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London and tweets at @RaheemKassam"}

There\u2019s no coincidence in terms of timing, and the timing was such that we did this investigation, we put it out there on Breitbart and elsewhere, I did a bunch of Polish media around it and then a Soros-backed outfit was at the same time funding Gazeta Wyborcza.\n\n\u201cAgora [which Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations recently took a large stake in] went in and bailed them out because the last government was doing so through PZU [a state owned insurance company] but with the electoral shift in power, that was no longer viable.\n\n\u201cSo MDIF [Media Development Investment Fund] comes in as a philanthropic entity that invests where \u2018free press is under assault,\u2019 which is obviously nonsense in Poland.\n\n\u201cHe comes in, and shortly after, Piatek writes a hit-piece filled with lies saying that I was on Trump\u2019s payroll and by extension that I was a [Vladimir] Putin shill.

He has also not been afraid to criticise the paper in previous articles.\n\nTyrmand said: \u201cI am an existential threat to them because I have the ability to go, not just in Poland where they are pretty well-hated and understood, but all over the world to talk about what they do and what they represent.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising that this piece especially, because it hit close to home with the investigation into Soros and KOD, who they are aligned with, meant that they pulled out all the stops in going after me.\u201d\n\nTyrmand\u2019s colleague James O\u2019Keefe, who Piatek referred to in his piece as a \u2018specialist in illegal recordings and eavesdropping,\u2019 was the first to take the witness stand on Wednesday, June 21.\n\n\u201cJames O\u2019Keefe coming to testify was really great, because here\u2019s a really high-profile crusader for journalistic truth and transparency in media,\u201d Tyrmand said.\n\n\u201cHim coming to Poland really helped establish the credibility of the argument as well as give it huge visibility, given his visibility,\u201d he added.\n\nIf he wins, Tyrmand wants an apology and 50,000 Polish zlotys which he intends to donate to five Polish charities. He also wants corrections to be made to the article.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not looking for them to strike the column. I\u2019d like the column to remain up but with highlights on each of the ten or dozen or so lies that I pinpointed, clarifying that they were not honest and giving the truth,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next court session takes place in November, where Tyrmand said will call more witnesses to the stand to testify on his behalf."}

In other words, to use the enemy\u2019s tactics against them.\n\nJust like CNN, just like Antifa, just like the left generally, the Japanese were a horrible enemy to fight: utterly without scruples, fanatically convinced of the justice of their wicked cause, terrifying in the swiftness with which they swarmed and overran your position. By the time you knew what had hit you, you\u2019d either be dead \u2014 if you were lucky \u2014 or tied, wounded, to a tree while the enemy got ready to use you for bayonet practice.\n\nIn the early stages of the war, the British and their fellow Allies were invariably on the back foot: how could they possibly defeat an enemy that didn\u2019t play by the rules, that showed no weakness, that seemed more demonic than human?\n\nAnyone who has ever seen action against the SJWs will know the feeling.\n\nThey hunt in packs; they swarm; they move as one as if controlled by some sinister hive mind; they are immune to reason; they are completely without mercy.\n\nI give you, as but one example among many, the case of poor Sir Tim Hunt \u2014 the Nobel-prize-winning scientist whose career was all but destroyed for no better reason than the SJW hive mind demanded fresh blood.\n\nThe truth (that Hunt was the victim of outrageous misreporting by a dodgy hack pursuing a militant feminist agenda) was no defense. Nor were any mitigating circumstances taken into account \u2014 like, say, the fact that this alleged sexist Prof ha, in fact, spent his entire career bending over backward to help and encourage female scientists. Nor was the fact that he apologized for his non-crime.\n\nAll that mattered as far as the SJWs were concerned was that here was another scalp for the taking. So take it they did.\n\nTo experience these terror tactics is a demoralizing and frightening thing.\n\nToo often the response of the right has been to feel a bit sorry for itself because it\u2019s all so unfair. And then persuade itself that if only it keeps on making the same arguments as before then eventually logic and truth will prevail because, after all, the facts of life are conservative.\n\nThere\u2019s at least one major problem with this response: the left isn\u2019t interested in logic and facts \u2014 and hasn\u2019t been for quite some time.\n\nThat was what James O\u2019Keefe recently uncovered \u2014 not that we couldn\u2019t have guessed anyway \u2014 with his recent sting on CNN. Here is an organization which affects the demeanor of a responsible, politically-neutral, internationally-respected news outlet with reporters and newscasters who look exactly like real ones on grown up TV channels. But underneath, its entire raison d\u2019etre and business model is churning out leftist fake news propaganda.\n\nIf conservative media outlets like Breitbart took the same liberties with the truth as leftist media outlets like CNN (and Vox and Slate and Salon and Huffpost and the rest\u2026) they would be crucified. But it\u2019s no use bleating about this: we just have to accept that this is the way the world works and just get on with the business of winning.\n\n#CNNBlackmail, make no mistake, was a pivotal #winning moment.\n\nWhy and how did we win? Partly by using the enemy\u2019s tactics against them; partly by exploiting a few strengths of our own.\n\nHere are some of them:\n\n\u201cSorry. Not interested\u201d\n\nBeing on the left is all about grievance, victimhood and \u2014 usually feigned \u2014 moral outrage. This was the card CNN tried playing in response to the original Trump wrestling gif. They invited us to believe that Trump\u2019s tweet encouraged \u201cviolence against reporters.\u201d We responded in the best way possible: by ignoring it. This may have been what infuriated CNN into making their massive tactical error of hunting down and trying to destroy the alleged creator of the gif. Had CNN shrugged its shoulders and ignored the wrestler gif, it would not be writhing in such abject humiliation now.\n\nJokes\n\nThe left has lots of comedians, but it can\u2019t do jokes: look at John Oliver, who, despite his lucrative gift of being able to persuade liberal studio audiences to make laugh-type noises, has never said anything genuinely funny in his life. This is because progressives are ideologically incapable of humor. We discuss this in more detail on my Delingpole podcast next week on a Special Youth Edition featuring a clever 18-year-old kid who understands the internet and memes and stuff. The reason the right is winning the internet war, he explains, is because our memes are much wittier than their memes. And the reason for that is that the left can\u2019t do humor because they\u2019re afraid it might hurt someone\u2019s feelings.\n\nPoint And Swarm; Isolate And Shriek\n\nAs Vox Day explains in his invaluable SJW Attack Survival Guide, these are classic techniques used by the regressive left. Now the tables have been turned, and we are learning to use their methods against them. CNN got so panicked after the backlash hit, it had to ban all its staff from using Twitter because whatever they did or said only seemed to make things worse. SJWs can dish it, but they really can\u2019t take it.\n\nAdvertisers\n\nAnother of the left\u2019s favorite dirty tricks is to target companies that advertise with conservative media organizations \u2014 and bully them into withdrawing their funding (see Kellogg\u2019s v Breitbart). On the right, we have traditionally been against such tactics because what you\u2019re essentially doing is fighting against two of the things we believe in \u2014 free markets and free speech. The tables were turned when advertisers including Audi (another company, incidentally, which withdrew its advertising from Breitbart) were attacked by outraged punters demanding to know why they fund a company as toxic as CNN.\n\nGive Them Enough Rope\u2026\n\nCNN is ISIS. It\u2019s a joke but it\u2019s also true: CNN is very much part of the axis of evil bent on destroying Western Civilization. We should never forget this \u2014 nor delude ourselves just because this particular battle involves frivolous stuff like memes of old martial arts video game characters with Trump\u2019s head and the CNN logo superimposed on them that somehow it isn\u2019t really important. I\u2019m with Thomas Wictor on this one:\n\n(1) Did I call it or what? #CNNBlackmail The mainstream media now sees itself as internal state security. pic.twitter.com/UnPZww7UwJ \u2014 Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) July 5, 2017\n\n(2) When journalists use their powers to dictate WHAT YOU WILL SAY, that means the press is now a secret police. \u2014 Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) July 5, 2017\n\nThat attack by CNN\u2019s sinister enforcer Andrew Kaczynski on Reddit user HanAssholeSolo was an outrageous act of overreach by the increasingly aggressive and hectoring left. It was the liberal media deciding that among its new roles is to police society\u2019s behavior and mores in the manner of the NKVD.\n\nDefinitely one good thing to have come out of #CNNBlackmail is that the enemy has shown its true colors. But the far, far better news is that the good guys have fought back.\n\nAnd the best news of all is: we\u2019re #winning."}

{"36": "Mexican authorities seized multiple packages of dynamite belonging to one faction of the Los Zetas cartel that operates in the border state of Tamaulipas. In addition to the explosives, authorities also seized body armor and more than a ton of marijuana stashed in the city of Mante.\n\nOfficials found the dynamite at a cartel stash house in the southern city of Mante, an area run by the Vieja Escuela Z faction of the Los Zetas Cartel. The region is about 282 miles south of the Texas border in a strategic territory used by organized crime groups.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to information provided to Breitbart Texas by the Tamaulipas government, the stash house was in the Las Brisas neighborhood. The house belonged to recently slain Vieja Escuela plaza boss Francisco \u201cTom Cabezon\u201d Garcia. As Breitbart Texas reported, Garcia was recently murdered during a prison \u201cfight\u201d in the Nuevo Laredo prison, a state facility near the Texas border where officials only recently transferred him.\n\nAccording to authorities, multiple law enforcement agencies carried out a surveillance operation and observed a man who acted in a \u201csuspicious fashion.\u201d Officials noticed the man carrying weapons and followed him to a house where he went inside.\n\nPolice officers raided the house and found five packages of dynamite sticks, six black bags with 2,204 pounds of marijuana, ten tactical vests with body armor, as well as ammunition for AK-47 type rifles. The suspected gunman managed to escape.\n\nThe large seizure came approximately 96 hours after the prison murder of Francisco \u201cTom Cabezon\u201d Garcia inside the Nuevo Laredo prison. The detention facility is controlled by the Cartel Del Noreste faction of the Los Zetas, a rival faction that has been at war with Vieja Escuela Z.\n\nGarcia inherited command of the Los Zetas in Ciudad Mante in April, shortly after the death of the previous leader Francisco \u201cPancho\u201d Carreon. Carreon controlled the central part of Tamaulipas and numerous communities in the state of San Luis Potosi.\n\nIn blogs that deal with cartel activities in Tamaulipas, alleged members of the Cartel Del Noreste took credit for Garcia\u2019s death. They warned about future violence coming from information that they had extracted through Garcia\u2019s torture. The post made allusions to Garcia\u2019s operations in Ciudad Mante and Ciudad Victoria where more both factions have been waging a fierce war for control.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Le\u00f3n to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities. The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

Two hours and 15 minutes of meetings, Tillerson and Trump are ready to forgive and forget when it comes to cyber attacks on the American election of 2016. Nobody is saying, Mr. President, the Russians changed the outcome. You won fair and square, but they did try to attack our election system. They were successful in many ways. And the more you do this, the more people are suspicious about you and Russia. He\u2019s got a great national security team around him. He\u2019s doing a good job in Afghanistan, North Korea, and ISIL, but when it comes to Russia, he\u2019s got a blind spot, and to forgive and forget when it comes to Putin regarding cyber attacks is to empower Putin, and that\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe seems to be willing to forgive and forget Putin. Even if he brought it up, he\u2019s not willing to do anything about it, so it makes me more committed than ever to get sanctions on President Trump\u2019s desk punishing Putin. There is only one person in Washington that I know of that has any doubt about what Russia did in our election, and that\u2019s President Trump.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen it comes to Russia, I am dumbfounded, I am disappointed, and at the end of the day he\u2019s hurting his presidency by not embracing the fact that Putin is a bad guy who tried to undercut our democracy and he\u2019s doing it all over the world.\u201d\n\nDiscussing sanctions on Russia, Graham added, \u201cAt the end of the day, the house needs to pass a bill. If you don\u2019t like our bill word for word, you can change it, but I\u2019m not going to gut the bill. I am intent on punishing the Russians for interfering in our election. They did it in France. They\u2019re going to do it in Germany. They\u2019re doing it all over the world. They\u2019re doing it in the Balkan states, their neighbors. So I want a clear message to Russia that you\u2019ll pay the price for cutting our democracy.

{"47": "Muslims in the United States should not assimilate into American society, but should instead act \u201cto please Allah and only Allah,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a rising star among progressive Democrats, last weekend.\n\nSarsour\u2019s remarks were part of a July 1 speech given at the annual meeting of the Islamic Society of North America, or ISNA. She said:\n\nadvertisement\n\nOur number one and top priority is to protect and defend our community. It is not to assimilate and to please any other people in authority. Our obligation is to our young people, is to our women, to make sure our women are protected in our community, and our top priority, even higher than all those priorities, is to please Allah and only Allah. We are never to cower to the powers that be, we are never to give up any part of our identity so somebody else can open a door for us. If a door does not open, guess what we do? We build a new door and walk through our own door, because we have that right in this country to also open opportunities for us and other communities.\n\nSarsour\u2019s speech was peppered with refusals to integrate into Americans\u2019 Western-style blends of secular government, religious freedoms, and civic society, or to compromise any aspects of Islamic doctrines, such as support for Muslim Palestinians living alongside Israel:\n\nWhat I believe that people can learn from my experience is that you can be unapologetically Muslim, unapologetically Palestinian-American, hold strong conviction, have strong ideology and politics and still become a mainstream American who can inspire and still resonate with people outside of the Muslim community\u2026 We do not have to give up any part of our identity\u2026 I will not be in a space where any group or any organization or individual tells me that there there is apart of my [Muslim] identity that is not welcome into any space. That, my sisters and brothers, is not going to fly with us in the Muslim community.\n\nShe urged Muslim groups to build alliances \u2013 but to not integrate \u2014 with other groups in America, saying \u201cYou are not [numerous] enough on your own \u2026. we need to build coalitions, we need allies.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarsour\u2019s orthodox Islamic separatism has attracted much criticism from Americans.\n\nLiberals: #IStandWithLinda even tho she\n\n\u2013 viciously attacked a survivor of FGM\n\n\u2013 gave the ISIS one finger salute\n\n\u2013 advocates Sharia Law pic.twitter.com/2vfdjWqV4h \u2014 Adam Blaze (@blaze42001) July 7, 2017\n\nIt is a poor fit with post-1964 U.S. society, and especially with the declared ideals of American progressives.\n\nAmerican progressives swear they oppose theocracies, favor democracies and free speech, favor economic opportunities and legal equality for women, oppose genital mutilation, and favor peace between Israel and nearly Arab Muslims.\n\nYet progressives are unwilling to treat religions as legitimate political factors. That contempt for religion allows progressives to support Sarsour in the hope she rallies immigrant Muslims against President Donald Trump.\n\nFor example, Sarsour was allowed to appear as one of the four media-boosted leaders of the January 21, 2017 \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d in D.C. against Trump. Similarly, she was recently invited to give a May keynote speech at the City University of New York while wearing her usual head-covering as a signal of her Islamic orthodoxy.\n\nWhen he was President, Barack Obama boosted Sarsour by naming her as a \u201cChampion of Change,\u201d as part of his campaign to recruit Muslims into the Democratic coalition of diverse minorities. Obama offered public endorsements off Islam, greater immigration of Muslims, and government aid such as welfare and healthcare. \u201cISNA continues to be a voice for cooperation and understanding \u2026 I see Muslim-American communities as our partner, and you\u2019ll always have a partner in me,\u201d Obama said in a videotaped speech to the 2015 ISNA meeting.\n\nSarsour\u2019s importance to progressives also explains why so many progressives rushed to excuse Sarsour\u2019s use of Islam\u2019s \u201cjihad\u201d war doctrine in her ISNA speech. She said:\n\nI hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts us from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or on the other side of the world, but here, in these United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.\n\nThat statement is not a direct call for direct open war against the government. But it is a demand that Muslims recognize an obligation under Islam\u2019s jihad doctrine to unite in political opposition to a perceived enemy \u2014 the elected president of the United States.\n\nIn her own defense, Sarsour subsequently retweeted claims that Islam\u2019s jihad doctrine also endorses non-violent actions.\n\nResistance to oppression can be violent and non-violent struggle. Clearly, @lsarsour was talking about the latter. https://t.co/qSFOMVK6iB \u2014 Jamil Dakwar (@jdakwar) July 7, 2017\n\nSarsour\u2019s ISNA speech include numerous Koranic references that reinforce her demand for Muslim separatism.\n\nFor example, she said, \u201cyou can count on me every single day to use my voice to stand up, not only to people outside our community who are oppressing our communities but those inside our community who aid and abet the oppressors outside of our community.\u201d\n\nSarsour\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201coppressor\u201d evokes many verses in the Koran, which repeatedly urges bloody warfare against people who limit Muslims\u2019 power. For example, verse 2:193 in the Koran declares:\n\nFight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.\n\nSarsour\u2019s call for Islamic self-segregation instead of integration echoes statements in the Koran, which Muslims believe is the directed and unchangeable transcript of Allah\u2019s commands. For example, the Koran tells Muslims not to depend on non-Muslim authorities, but to unite as one Muslim \u201cummah\u201d against all non-Muslim powers.\n\n\u201cO you who believe ! Do not take Jews and Christians as your patrons. They are patrons of their own people. He among you who will turn to them for patronage is one of them.\n\nThe same verse is also translated as:\n\nO you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you \u2013 then indeed, he is [one] of them.\n\nMuslims must unite \u201cas one umma we are supposed to be,\u201d Sarsour said.\n\nShe also suggested to the Islamic leaders at her speech that opposition to Trump is an individual Islamic religious duty, or a \u201cfard al-ayn,\u201d by saying \u201cwhen the day comes that something horrific happens to us or to another community, you will be responsible for normalizing this administration.\u201d\n\nSarsour\u2019s frank demands for an Islamic political movement and for a self-segregated Islamic society in the United States echoes the broadly accepted strategy of self-segregation among Islamic activists in Europe and the United States. The separatist strategy is intended to grow their populations while shielding them from surrounding secular and Christian cultures, which Islamic believers see as profoundly illegitimate. For example, Sarsour repeatedly referred to \u201cthese United States of America,\u201d not \u201cThe United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic groups are also testing that strategy in the United States. For example, Islamic activists rejected Obama\u2019s so-called \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d plan, which sought to reduce Islamic attacks in the United States by fostering counterterrorism cooperation with Islamic groups, including ISNA. But Islamic groups demanded more autonomy, including the legal authority to police their own co-religionists, in exchange for a promised reduction in domestic jihad attacks.\n\nBecause of that hostility, President Donald Trump\u2019s deputies have changed the nation\u2019s anti-jihad strategy. The new strategy emphasizes policing without reliance on cooperation from activists, such as Sarsour. The new strategy is based on the likelihood that the activist Islamic groups \u2014 such as ISNA and the Sarsour\u2019s groups \u2014 can be bypassed with effective outreach and cooperation with ordinary people \u2014- parents and employers, for example \u2014 who are part of the various Muslim neighborhoods and groups.\n\nDespite the media-magnified role of ISNA and various other Muslim political groups, it is not clear how much sway they have over Muslim Americans, many of whom rarely attend mosques and frequently drink alcohol. Sarsour\u2019s speech got a tepid response at the ISNA convention, partly because she insisted that the older Muslim leaders donate more funding to political activists, such as herself and like-minded firebrands, and also delegate more political power and visibility to younger, American-born Muslims.\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC"}

{"56": "The Chinese state newspaper Global Times is warning authors of danmei, a majority female-written genre of online gay fiction, which communist government officials have banned; they are offering digital currency in exchange for reporting the \u201cvulgar\u201d content.\n\nGlobal Times approaches the topic from an economic standpoint, noting that outlets that have had success publishing danmei fear that they will no longer be able to profit from the content, as foreign distributors interested in buying the fiction now fear running afoul of the Chinese government.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cI was in the process of selling the adaptation rights of some of our novels and even considered bringing in investors to expand the platform. The investors initially showed great interest but after the release of the two regulations last week, they got cold feet,\u201d an anonymous owner of a danmei website told the government-controlled outlet.\n\nThe crackdown is part of a larger censorship system debuting last week. According to the Times, \u201cThe State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) made public a guideline that says all online literary platforms will be assessed annually on an 100-point scale, of which 30 points will be dedicated to \u2018value guidance and style of thought.'\u201d\n\nAll works of fiction must now \u201creflect core socialist values and abide by moral norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regulation demands that up to 20 points be attributed to whether the platform has provided enough literary works that reflect core socialist values,\u201d the report added, noting that the grossest violations of \u201cvalue guidance\u201d would be any content that questions or challenges China\u2019s communist system (\u201cserious political error\u201d).\n\nSAPPRFT also unveiled a new initiative in which all movie theaters in China must screen communist propaganda before the beginning of films. Television outlets must now also broadcast at least seventeen \u201cpropagandistic drama series approved by the government\u201d each.\n\nWhile typically reflecting the Chinese government\u2019s party line and regurgitating belligerent state propaganda against the United States, the Global Times has printed comments from individuals referring to homosexuality as \u201cnormal and natural, if only present among \u201ca small group of people.\u201d That remark, from a sexologist, came in response to new online censorship from the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA), which banned \u201cpornography and vulgar tastes including abnormal sexual relations such as incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, as well as unhealthy views on marriage such as sexual freedom and wife swapping.\u201d\n\nCommunist dictatorships have traditionally abused the rights of their LGBT citizens, placing them in labor camps or executing them for their \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d behavior. China is no different; while there are no known statistics on the number of LGBT individuals killed or imprisoned under Mao Zedong, there is ample evidence of such abuse. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but instances of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d abuses persisted.\n\nDanmei, the gay fiction genre in question in the Times article, consists of more than consensual adult gay activity, however. Many of the stories, the New York Times reported in a 2014 story on the genre, involve abuse of men and father-son incest; though a high percentage of danmei authors are women, few of the characters created are. Some fantasies in question, the New York Times cites a scholar explaining, are meant to subconsciously \u201csubvert the state.\u201d The same year this profile surfaced, the Chinese government arrested over twenty women for participating in writing gay fiction online.\n\nThe crackdown on danmei is part of a broader initiative by President Xi Jinping to suppress any organic expressions of Chinese culture that the government cannot control and replace it with \u201csocialist family values.\u201d In December 2016, Xi delivered a speech calling for a \u201cnew trend toward socialist family values,\u201d followed by a crackdown on dating television shows, online video that did not conform to \u201ccorrect political and aesthetic standards,\u201d and any media promoting \u201cWestern lifestyles.\u201d"}

The state of Hawaii wants a broader definition that would include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and possibly more distant relations.\n\nLate Friday, the Ninth Circuit said no to Hawaii\u2019s request for an emergency appeal of Judge Watson\u2019s denial, saying it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n\nBut the liberal judges on the panel could not resist giving Hawaii a road map to get what they want.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit ruled that Hawaii should have asked Judge Watson to modify his previous injunction halting the Executive Order on March 15 (partially overturned by the Supreme Court on June 26) instead of asking for him to \u201cclarify\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn order to obtain a temporary partial victory in the matter, the state of Hawaii could now appeal the current 9th Circuit decision directly to the Supreme Court\u2013which could issue a ruling even though it is not in session if Justice Kennedy, who has that authority, chooses to act alone on behalf of SCOTUS.\n\nEach court of appeals is under the supervision of a justice. Kennedy is the circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit. One of the things a circuit justice can do solo is to stay any appellate decision from his circuit.\n\nAlternatively, it could follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s advice, file a new motion with Judge Watson, and hope for a favorable ruling, which would likely be appealed by the Department of Justice to the Ninth Circuit, whose ruling would be appealed to the Supreme Court again by the losing party.\n\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reports: \u201cRefugee resettlement agencies say the State Department has given them updated instructions on President Trump\u2019s travel ban that extends the cutoff date for refugee admissions.\u201d\n\nWhen the ban was put into place last week, the administration said refugees who had booked travel would be admitted through Thursday. After that, immigration officials would block all refugees, except those who could prove they had U.S. connections, such as close relatives. The July 6 date was a government estimate of when the country would reach a 50,000-person cap on refugee admissions this fiscal year. Federal officials now estimate that the cap will be hit a week later, according to refugee groups. State Department figures show that 49,225 refugees had arrived in the U.S. as of June 30. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration at the State Department would not confirm the change and said more information would come out Thursday.\n\nHIAS, one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the country and a plaintiff in the related IRAP v. Trump case that was also decided on March 15 and consolidated with the Hawaii v. Trump case that was wrapped into the June 26 Supreme Court decision, is aggressively seeking more refugees despite the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cThe cap could be hit earlier, so it could be earlier than July 12,\u201d Mark Hetfield, the Chief Executive Officer of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) told The Times.\n\nThe number of refugees arriving in the United States plummeted in the first week following the June 26 Supreme Court decision, though the subsequent four days between July 4 and July 7 saw the number of refugees increase by 578, which is about the daily rate seen in the previous eight weeks.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, July 8, according to the State Department website, 49,803 refugees have been admitted to the United States in FY 2017, which is 197 below the 50,000 ceiling President Trump set in Executive Order 13780.\n\nAt the current rate of refugee arrivals, that 50,000 ceiling will likely be reached on either Monday, July 10 or Tuesday, July 11."}
{"64": "The two largest parties in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD), have largely refused to acknowledge migrant issues in their campaign ahead of September\u2019s national election.\n\nThe migrant crisis, which peaked in 2015, is arguably the single largest event to affect Germany in recent years but has been marginalised by both major German political parties. Neither the CDU of German Chancellor Angela Merkel nor the SPD of former European Union Parliament President Martin Schulz have spoken at length about the issue despite the recent rise of arrivals in Italy, Der Spiegel reports.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRecently, Chancellor Merkel met with the leader of the CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union\u2019s (CSU) Horst Seehofer, to announce their platform for the September national election. Merkel made no comments at all about the migrant crisis, choosing instead to focus on the economy promising 3 per cent unemployment by 2025.\n\nMr. Seehofer, known to be much more vocal on migrant issues having previously called for a national limit on asylum seekers, said he was \u201cvery satisfied with the number of migrants\u201d coming into Germany in 2017. He claimed that so far around 80,000 people had come to Germany, still below the CSU\u2019s proposed limit of 200,000 per year.\n\nThe marginalising of the migrant issue is a major departure from late last year when some worried that migration issues were creating a rift between Merkel and Seehofer with the latter threatening not to campaign with Merkel if no limit was set.\n\nThe SPD has not mentioned the migrant crisis, either, with leader Martin Schulz campaigning largely on undoing labour reforms and strengthing unions. Schulz has only addressed the migrant issue by threatening Hungary with taking away EU subsidies if the Central European country continues to refuse to accept redistributed migrants from Greece and Italy.\n\nThe two parties see the migrant crisis as a hard issue to gain politically from and so have largely remained quiet on the matter. The anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany is one of the few parties to be very vocal on the subject, but after former leader Frauke Petry stepped down, the party has slumped in polls from a high of 16 per cent last September.\n\nGermany, Civey poll: CDU/CSU-EPP: 37% \u2191\n\nSPD-S&D: 25% \u2191\n\nLINKE-LEFT: 9%\n\nFDP-ALDE: 9%\n\nAfD-ENF: 8% \u2193\n\nGR\u00dcNE-G/EFA: 8%#btw17 \u2014 Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) June 13, 2017\n\nThe migrant crisis is rapidly becoming the central issue across Europe as the number of migrants coming into Italy continues to grow with one 48 hour period seeing 13,500 migrants arrive in Italy from North Africa.\n\nAs a result of the surge of migrants, the Austrian government has threatened to deploy the military on the Italian border to stop migrants from entering the country. Austria also has an election later this year; however, in contrast to Germany, the migrant crisis is a major campaign issue."}

{"66": "Henry Olsen\u2019s The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism is an immensely valuable book, not least because its insights are relevant to the current debate over health care policy.\n\nThe primary argument of the book is that Reagan was not the anti-government crusader that he is often remembered to be, but sought to protect Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal while dismantle Lyndon Johnson\u2019 Great Society.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOlsen makes a strong argument that Reagan believed government should support the needy, and that his main objection to the liberal welfare state was that it went much further than that, seizing power to serve the utopian visions of unelected bureaucrats, limiting Americans\u2019 potential for success.\n\nOlsen does not answer \u2014 nor, really, did Reagan \u2014 the question of whether the very existence of those government departments and programs leads to those statist excesses. Olsen\u2019s diagnosis of the causes of present-day Republican divisions is also inaccurate. He seems to blame the Tea Party movement for punishing deviations from conservative orthodoxy, though he does seem to acknowledge that it was the party establishment that launched the first shots after 2012, believing the party base had pushed Gov. Mitt Romney too far to the right on immigration.\n\nHe makes a comment, in passing, accusing Donald Trump of \u201cnot-so-veiled racialism and white nationalism,\u201d a claim he does not prove (and does not repeat). Yet Olsen\u2019s insights help explain why Trump attracted the same working-class voters that lifted Reagan to victory.\n\nOn Obamacare, Olsen says Reagan would have backed repeal:\n\nReagan would definitely have wanted to repeal Obamacare. Its rules and regulations put the government in the driver\u2019s seat in determining what care should be delivered, to whom, and at what price. This is exactly the sort of government-directed society that Reagan believed was opposed to American principles.\n\nHowever, he adds, Reagan also would have wanted to preserve parts of Obamacare:\n\nIt\u2019s less clear what he would have wanted to replace it with. I think, however, it is pretty clear he would have wanted to ensure that people would not lose coverage that they had received as a result of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. His consistent belief that it was OK for government to pay for needed medical care for those who could not afford it makes that plain. The details as to who should be covered, how much the government should pay, and what level of care they would be guaranteed would be up for discussion, but I can\u2019t imagine that Reagan would be more concerned about money than about life.\n\nAbove all, Olsen argues, Reagan would have opposed an approach that placed conservative ideological goals ahead of what was best for ordinary people \u2014 for the \u201ctruckers and cashiers\u201d who lay at the heart of his political vision.\n\nJoel B.

During an interview, detectives learned that two individuals forced the juvenile into prostitution after one of them allegedly trafficked her to Houston from another state. She identified her captors as Teresa Henry and Centurrie Garrett (shown in photos above). She told detectives Henry trafficked her from out of state and both suspects had compelled her into prostitution.\n\nThe detectives located and arrested Henry and Garrett and charged them with Compelling Prostitution of a Minor.

{"74": "If Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) enters the 2020 presidential race, the establishment media will be looking to Breitbart News to see how conservatives will attack her candidacy, according to Politico\u2019s California Playbook.\n\nCalifornia Playbook writers Carla Marinucci, David Siders, and Diamond Naga Siu pointed out on Friday that Harris has been garnering \u201ca flurry of will-she-or-won\u2019t-she, 2020-focused stories detailing her every move on Capitol Hill (and back in California).\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey then said Breitbart News is previewing where conservative media will go should Harris enter the 2020 race:\n\nRIGHT WING REVS UP: A preview of where the GOP, and the rightwing media, will go on Harris, should she ever begin serious efforts at a 2020 White House run. That first trip to Iowa hasn\u2019t been scheduled \u2013 but if or when it is, well, brace yourselves, Kamala fans:\n\nCalifornia Playbook then linked to a Breitbart News article about two veteran California journalists who ripped Harris for being a \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic\u201d lightweight.\n\nIn that article, Breitbart News also pointed out that, \u201cDemocrats, especially operatives who may see her as a vehicle they can use to line their pockets or enhance their profiles en route to television contracts, have been hyping Harris as the party\u2019s next big star. \u201c\n\nThough Joel Pollak and Sam Chi at Breitbart California have kept tabs on Harris, those on the left and in the establishment media have been just as critical. This week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) seemed to tell Harris, in the words of ESPN\u2019s Lee Corso, \u201cnot so fast,\u201d when Feinstein told the New York Times, \u201cshe just got here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she should do is concentrate on being a good, and possibly great, United States senator,\u201d Feinstein continued.\n\nTwo veteran journalists in Harris\u2019 home state recently wrote that Harris is a show horse who is taking \u201cbad advice from the craven whisperers around her.\u201d They said there is \u201cnot much there there,\u201d and Harris is just \u201cthe flavor of the week among the big grains in the Beltway.\u201d\n\nHarris Ain\u2019t The Next Barack Obama\n\nShould Harris somehow enter the 2020 race, she would need considerable support from black Democrats, especially in the South, who make up the heart and soul of the party\u2019s primary electorate.\n\nBut here\u2019s the inconvenient truth\u2014Harris has shown no indication that she can galvanize these important voters like Barack Obama did or Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) possibly can. In fact, she has not even shown to date that she could be as effective as John Edwards was.\n\nBefore Obama won his party\u2019s nomination, columnists like Stanley Crouch were questioning whether Obama, having grown up in fairly insulated Hawaii and abroad, understood the experiences of black Americans. In his 2006 column titled, \u201cWhat Obama Isn\u2019t: Black Like Me on Race,\u201d Crouch wrote that if the country ends up with the \u201cthe son of a white woman and an African immigrant\u201d as \u201cour first black President, he will have come into the White House through a side door \u2013 which might, at this point, be the only one that\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nObama, days before the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in March of 2007, went to Selma, Alabama and delivered a rousing speech. Obama, assuaging many establishment black Democrats who were skeptical of his fast rise, said then:\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not coming home when I come to Selma, Alabama. I\u2019m here because somebody marched for our freedom. I\u2019m here because y\u2019all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the Moses generation. But we have got to remember now that Joshua still had a job to do. As great as Moses was, despite all that he did, leading a people out of bondage, he didn\u2019t cross over the river to see the promised land. God told him, your job is done, you\u2019ll see it. You\u2019ll be at the mountaintop, and you can see what I\u2019ve promised, what I promised to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and I promised to you, you can see that I will fulfill that promise.\n\nBooker meanwhile, in addition to effectively using Twitter like Obama\u2019s squad used Facebook, has been giving passionate speeches in which he weaves in James Baldwin, William Lloyd Garrison, and Robert Smalls. He talks about the \u201cimpossible dream,\u201d recounts growing up in black churches, and describes how dogs were unleashed on his father and a volunteer real estate agent who was helping his family integrate a New Jersey neighborhood during his childhood.\n\nEven Edwards, in a seminal \u201csilence is betrayal\u201d address at New York\u2019s famed Riverside Church in which he apologized for supporting the Iraq War during the 2008 election cycle, appealed to the hearts of black voters better than Harris has done to date:\n\nAs he put it then, there comes a time\u2013not just for Dr. King, but for all of us\u2013when silence is betrayal\u2013not just betrayal of your own personal convictions, not just betrayal of your country, but a betrayal of our\u2013all of our joint responsibility to each other, to our brothers and sisters, not just in America, but all across the globe. \u2026 There does come a time when we have to each one of us refuse to wait for others to act\u2013a moment when we realize, as one of Dr. King\u2019s great teachers, Gandhi, said, we have to be the change that we want to see in the world. That time is here again. It\u2019s with us today. Dr. King taught us well. I believe, as I know many of you do, that it is a betrayal, a betrayal to stand silent and watch 37 million of our own brothers and sisters who literally worry about surviving, every single day. It is a betrayal to stand silent while the disparity between he rich and the poor gets worse and worse and worse, every single day in America, in the richest nation on the face of the planet. And I also believe that it is a betrayal not to speak out against an escalation of the War in Iraq.\n\nHarris, in the meantime, talks about \u201cfighting\u201d various policies, grandstands at Senate hearings, opposes Republicans taking away \u201cour stuff,\u201d and hurls F-bombs.\n\nAs Calbuzz\u2019s journalists noted, so far, there really isn\u2019t much there there."}

{"77": "The two largest parties in Germany, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Social Democrats (SPD), have largely refused to acknowledge migrant issues in their campaign ahead of September\u2019s national election.\n\nThe migrant crisis, which peaked in 2015, is arguably the single largest event to affect Germany in recent years but has been marginalised by both major German political parties. Neither the CDU of German Chancellor Angela Merkel nor the SPD of former European Union Parliament President Martin Schulz have spoken at length about the issue despite the recent rise of arrivals in Italy, Der Spiegel reports.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRecently, Chancellor Merkel met with the leader of the CDU\u2019s sister party, the Bavarian Christian Social Union\u2019s (CSU) Horst Seehofer, to announce their platform for the September national election. Merkel made no comments at all about the migrant crisis, choosing instead to focus on the economy promising 3 per cent unemployment by 2025.\n\nMr. Seehofer, known to be much more vocal on migrant issues having previously called for a national limit on asylum seekers, said he was \u201cvery satisfied with the number of migrants\u201d coming into Germany in 2017. He claimed that so far around 80,000 people had come to Germany, still below the CSU\u2019s proposed limit of 200,000 per year.\n\nThe marginalising of the migrant issue is a major departure from late last year when some worried that migration issues were creating a rift between Merkel and Seehofer with the latter threatening not to campaign with Merkel if no limit was set.\n\nThe SPD has not mentioned the migrant crisis, either, with leader Martin Schulz campaigning largely on undoing labour reforms and strengthing unions. Schulz has only addressed the migrant issue by threatening Hungary with taking away EU subsidies if the Central European country continues to refuse to accept redistributed migrants from Greece and Italy.\n\nThe two parties see the migrant crisis as a hard issue to gain politically from and so have largely remained quiet on the matter.

{"82": "HAMBURG, Germany (AP) \u2014 The United States and Russia struck an agreement Friday on a cease-fire in southwest Syria, crowning President Donald Trump\u2019s first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is the first US-Russian effort under Trump\u2019s presidency to stem Syria\u2019s six-year civil war.\n\nThe cease-fire goes into effect Sunday at noon Damascus time, according to US officials and the Jordanian government, which is also involved in the deal.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who accompanied Trump in his meeting with Putin, said the understanding is designed to reduce violence in an area of Syria near Jordan\u2019s border that is critical to the US ally\u2019s security.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cvery complicated part of the Syrian battlefield,\u201d Tillerson told reporters after the US and Russian leaders met for more than 2 hours on the sidelines of a global summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nOf the agreement, he said, \u201cI think this is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria.\u201d\n\nFor years, the former Cold War foes have been backing opposing sides in Syria\u2019s war. Moscow has staunchly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, supporting Syrian forces militarily since 2015. Washington has backed rebels fighting Assad. Both the US and Russia oppose Islamic State militants and say they\u2019re focused on rooting out the extremist group.\n\nThe potential pitfalls for the cease-fire are clear \u2014 not least the challenge of enforcing it.\n\nRussia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russian military police would monitor the new truce. But Tillerson said that was still being worked out. A senior US State Department official said the two countries were close to a deal on that issue and hoped to finalize it in the coming days, raising the prospect it could take effect Sunday with no clear sense of who is policing it.\n\nThat the deal was announced before all the details were ironed out was a clear indication of how eager the U.S. and Russia were to cast their leaders\u2019 first meeting as a success. Officials said the deal had been in the works for weeks or months, but came together in time for the meeting.\n\nThe deal marks a new level of involvement for the Trump administration in trying to resolve Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nTrump ordered some 60 cruise missiles to be fired at a Syrian air base in April after accusing Assad\u2019s forces of a deadly chemical weapons attack. But his top military and national security advisers pointedly said they had no intentions of intervening to oust Assad. And they stopped short of endorsing Russian-led or UN peace mediation efforts between Assad\u2019s government and rebel groups.\n\nIsrael also is part of the agreement, one US official said, who like others wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. Like Jordan, Israel shares a border with the southern part of Syria and has been concerned about a spillover of violence as well as an amassing of Iranian-aligned forces in the south of the country.\n\nJordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani confirmed the accord in a statement that made no reference to Israel\u2019s participation. Syrian government forces and its allies will stay on one side of an agreed demarcation line, and rebel fighters will stick to the other side. The goal is also to enable aid to reach this area of Syria, Momani told state media. US officials said the US, Russia and Jordan had only agreed on that demarcation line last week, clearing the way for a cease-fire to be worked out.\n\nThe deal is separate from an agreement that Russia, Turkey and Iran struck earlier this year to try to establish \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d in Syria with reduced bloodshed. The US, wary of Iran\u2019s involvement, stayed away from that effort. Follow-up talks this week in Kazakhstan were unable to produce agreement on finalizing a cease-fire in those zones.\n\nPrevious cease-fires in Syria have collapsed or failed to reduce violence for long, and it was unclear whether this deal would be any better.\n\nTillerson said the difference this time is Russia\u2019s interest in seeing Syria return to stability. It\u2019s an argument top US officials such as former Secretary of State John Kerry cited regularly amid his failed efforts to end a conflict that has killed as many as a half-million people, contributed to Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II and allowed IS to emerge as a global terror threat.\n\nTillerson also repeated the US position that a \u201clong-term role for the Assad family and the Assad regime\u201d is untenable and voiced his belief that Russia might be willing to address the future leadership of Syria, in tones reminiscent of Kerry. Up to now, Assad has rejected any proposals that would see him leave power, contributing to an impasse that has prolonged Syria\u2019s suffering.\n\nEarlier in the week, Syria\u2019s military said it was halting combat operations in the south of Syria for four days, in advance of the new round of Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan. That move covered the southern provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida. Syria\u2019s government briefly extended that unilateral cease-fire, which is now set to expire Saturday \u2014 a day before the U.S. and Russian deal was to take effect.\n\nThe US-Russian cease-fire has no set end date, one US official said, describing it as part of broader discussions with Moscow on lowering violence in Syria.\n\nThe agreement may also reflect Iran\u2019s increasingly prominent role in Syria.\n\nWashington has been resistant to letting Iranian forces and their proxy militias gain strength in Syria\u2019s south, a position shared by Israel and Jordan. Friday\u2019s deal could help the Trump administration retain more of a say over who fills the power vacuum left behind as the Islamic State is routed from additional territory in Syria.\n\nIn recent weeks, US forces have shot down a Syrian aircraft that got too close to American forces, as well as Iranian-made drones. A renewed government offensive against Western-backed rebels and Islamic militants in the contested province of Daraa also is sparking tensions, and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters have shifted south to join the fight.\n\nIsrael has also struck Syrian military installations on several occasions in the past few weeks after shells landed in the Israeli side of the Golan Heights. Ahead of the deal, media reports in Israel have suggested unease at any arrangement that relies on Russia policing areas near its frontier.\n\nImplications for Syria aside, the deal marks the biggest diplomatic achievement for the US and Russia since Trump took office. Trump\u2019s administration has approached the notoriously strained relationship by trying to identify a few limited issues on which the countries could make progress, thereby building trust for a broader repair of ties."}

Specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital said they had exhausted all treatment options and told Charlie\u2019s parents, Connie Yates and Chris Gard, their son would be removed from life support.\n\nThe London hospital declined assistance from the Vatican hospital, citing decisions by the U.K. domestic courts and the European Court of Human Rights, both of which ruled that removal from life support was in Charlie\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d\n\nCharlie\u2019s parents, however, raised about $1.7 million privately to take their son to the United States for experimental treatment.

{"91": "The Palestinians\u2019 decision to use the United Nations to claim Hebron\u2019s Tomb of the Patriarchs as their own heritage site is a direct slap to President Donald Trump, who is attempting to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump decided to delay the long-promised move of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, for fear of upsetting the Palestinians. But that did not stop the Palestinians from making their own move.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe idea that the Tomb of the Patriarchs is \u201cPalestinian\u201d is absurd. For thousands of years \u2014 long before Islam even existed \u2014 it has been among the holiest sites in Judaism, and also the oldest. According to tradition, the Tomb is the grave of the Biblical patriarchs and matriarchs \u2014 founders of the Jewish faith, and of monotheism itself: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah. (The fourth matriarch, Rachel, is buried near Bethlehem.)\n\nThe title deed to the Tomb is provided by the Bible itself, in Genesis 23. Abraham insisted on buying the site, even though the owner was prepared to give it to him as a gift, precisely so that there would never be any confusion in the future about its ownership. Later, King David established his throne in Hebron (II Samuel 5), and Jews lived there for millennia until they were massacred in a 1929 pogrom, returning after Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 war.\n\nThe Tomb is holy to both Muslims and Jews, and access to it is governed by a 1997 agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Rather than building upon that agreement towards a broader peace, the Palestinians have violated the spirit of the Hebron deal. They are not only claiming the Tomb, and the city, as part of a future Palestinian state. They are also claiming the past as part of a mythical Palestinian heritage, displacing the Jews.\n\nThe Palestinians\u2019 move on Hebron is toxic to the peace process. But it also destroys any complaint the Palestinians might have against the U.S. moving its embassy to Jerusalem. Indeed, moving the embassy is suddenly an urgent priority, because the Palestinians clearly intend to continue advancing their claims in Jerusalem and elsewhere. The same UN body (UNESCO) that acted against Hebron last week has also denied the Jewish connection to Jerusalem.\n\nAs the Jerusalem Post warned Sunday, the resolution on Hebron is only the beginning of a Palestinian diplomatic assault against Israel that uses fabricated history and the UN\u2019s endemic anti-Israel bias to circumvent negotiations.\n\nThe Palestinians\u2019 move in Hebron comes as Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas has vowed never to end payments to terrorists and their families using U.S. taxpayer money, despite direct requests by President Trump and his emissaries. Clearly the Palestinians have no interest in compromise, nor do they fear the consequences of their provocative behavior, because thus far the U.S. and the world have been unwilling to punish them for it.\n\nMoving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem is a consequence the Palestinians would understand. It need not actually change the status of the city, since the western part of Jerusalem, where Israel\u2019s government is already based, is never going to be under Palestinian control, under any peace agreement contemplated thus far. But it would end, once and for all, the Palestinian and Islamist fantasy that all of Israel will one day fall under Palestinian rule.\n\nMoving the embassy would be a unilateral decision. But as the Palestinians\u2019 own behavior shows, they have no qualms about unilateralism. Ironically, they have given President Trump a perfect opportunity to fulfill his promise.\n\nJoel B.

{"94": "Nearly 30 years after their initial installation, the iconic \u201crunning immigrant\u201d yellow signs that once dotted California\u2019s freeways near the southern border have been disappearing over the past several years. Now there\u2019s just one left.\n\nThe yellow signs featured a silhouette of the figure of a man running hard, with a woman trailing behind, clutching the wrist of a little girl with her pigtails flying, and the word \u201cCAUTION\u201d above the illustration. The signs were meant to alert drivers of illegal immigrants running across the freeway near border checkpoints.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere were once a dozen or so of these signs, along the Interstate 5 Freeway near the San Ysidro border crossing south of San Diego as well as a stretch of the 5 Freeway along Camp Pendleton just before it reaches the San Clemente Border Patrol checkpoint near the Orange County line. But over the years, accidents and vandalism have wiped out most of the signs, with just one remaining now near San Ysidro.\n\nThe signs were installed after more than 100 people were killed trying to cross the freeway in the 1980s. In 1986, illegal crossings in the San Diego sector reached an all-time high, with 628,000 apprehensions, according to Department of Homeland Security statistics. According to the Los Angeles Times, the area \u2014 geographically the smallest for Border Patrol \u2014 was once the busiest sector for illegal immigration in the U.S., accounting for more than 40 percent of nationwide apprehensions in the early \u201990s.\n\nIn the 1990s, federal officials decided to erect a wall between the U.S. and Mexico in the San Diego area and as a result, illegal crossings migrated east to Arizona and Texas. By 2016 Border Patrol agents apprehended 31,891 people in the San Diego sector suspected of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\n\nBut in the 1980s the freeway crossings were a real danger to both the drivers and illegals trying to evade Border Patrol. In the Camp Pendleton area of the 5 Freeway, oftentimes human smugglers would order the illegals they were shuttling to cross 8-10 lanes of high-speed freeway traffic to get to the beachside and proceed on foot until they were past the checkpoint. More than a few occasions, the illegals would be run over by speeding and unsuspecting drivers right in front of their family members.\n\nCaltrans then decided to replace the ineffective text signs that read \u201cCaution: Watch for People Crossing Road,\u201d and enlisted its graphic artist John Hood to design a new sign. A Vietnam vet who grew up in a Navajo reservation, Hood drew on his experience from the war as well as stories his parents told him about the Navajo flight and came up a sign that conveyed both urgency and fear.\n\nThe new signs immediately drew lots of attention as well as criticism. Some Latino activists deemed the faceless silhouettes racist. Anti-illegal immigration advocates thought the state should not spend money to protect people who were breaking the law. But entrepreneurs loved it. Since the image remained public property and no one had to pay Caltrans for its use, souvenirs featuring a variation of the \u201crunning immigrants\u201d propped up all over Southern California on T-shirts, stickers, and flags.\n\n\u201cYou create your work, and that\u2019s the extent of it. You never envision something like that to happen,\u201d Hood to the Times about the sign\u2019s evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s become an iconic element. It lives on.\u201d"}
{"95": "Muslims in the United States should not assimilate into American society, but should instead act \u201cto please Allah and only Allah,\u201d said Linda Sarsour, a rising star among progressive Democrats, last weekend.\n\nSarsour\u2019s remarks were part of a July 1 speech given at the annual meeting of the Islamic Society of North America, or ISNA. She said:\n\nadvertisement\n\nOur number one and top priority is to protect and defend our community. It is not to assimilate and to please any other people in authority. Our obligation is to our young people, is to our women, to make sure our women are protected in our community, and our top priority, even higher than all those priorities, is to please Allah and only Allah. We are never to cower to the powers that be, we are never to give up any part of our identity so somebody else can open a door for us. If a door does not open, guess what we do? We build a new door and walk through our own door, because we have that right in this country to also open opportunities for us and other communities.\n\nSarsour\u2019s speech was peppered with refusals to integrate into Americans\u2019 Western-style blends of secular government, religious freedoms, and civic society, or to compromise any aspects of Islamic doctrines, such as support for Muslim Palestinians living alongside Israel:\n\nWhat I believe that people can learn from my experience is that you can be unapologetically Muslim, unapologetically Palestinian-American, hold strong conviction, have strong ideology and politics and still become a mainstream American who can inspire and still resonate with people outside of the Muslim community\u2026 We do not have to give up any part of our identity\u2026 I will not be in a space where any group or any organization or individual tells me that there there is apart of my [Muslim] identity that is not welcome into any space. That, my sisters and brothers, is not going to fly with us in the Muslim community.\n\nShe urged Muslim groups to build alliances \u2013 but to not integrate \u2014 with other groups in America, saying \u201cYou are not [numerous] enough on your own \u2026. we need to build coalitions, we need allies.\u201d\n\n\n\nSarsour\u2019s orthodox Islamic separatism has attracted much criticism from Americans.\n\nLiberals: #IStandWithLinda even tho she\n\n\u2013 viciously attacked a survivor of FGM\n\n\u2013 gave the ISIS one finger salute\n\n\u2013 advocates Sharia Law pic.twitter.com/2vfdjWqV4h \u2014 Adam Blaze (@blaze42001) July 7, 2017\n\nIt is a poor fit with post-1964 U.S. society, and especially with the declared ideals of American progressives.\n\nAmerican progressives swear they oppose theocracies, favor democracies and free speech, favor economic opportunities and legal equality for women, oppose genital mutilation, and favor peace between Israel and nearly Arab Muslims.\n\nYet progressives are unwilling to treat religions as legitimate political factors. That contempt for religion allows progressives to support Sarsour in the hope she rallies immigrant Muslims against President Donald Trump.\n\nFor example, Sarsour was allowed to appear as one of the four media-boosted leaders of the January 21, 2017 \u201cWomen\u2019s March\u201d in D.C. against Trump. Similarly, she was recently invited to give a May keynote speech at the City University of New York while wearing her usual head-covering as a signal of her Islamic orthodoxy.\n\nWhen he was President, Barack Obama boosted Sarsour by naming her as a \u201cChampion of Change,\u201d as part of his campaign to recruit Muslims into the Democratic coalition of diverse minorities. Obama offered public endorsements off Islam, greater immigration of Muslims, and government aid such as welfare and healthcare. \u201cISNA continues to be a voice for cooperation and understanding \u2026 I see Muslim-American communities as our partner, and you\u2019ll always have a partner in me,\u201d Obama said in a videotaped speech to the 2015 ISNA meeting.\n\nSarsour\u2019s importance to progressives also explains why so many progressives rushed to excuse Sarsour\u2019s use of Islam\u2019s \u201cjihad\u201d war doctrine in her ISNA speech. She said:\n\nI hope that we, when we stand up to those who oppress our communities, that Allah accepts us from us that as a form of jihad, that we are struggling against tyrants and rulers, not only abroad in the Middle East or on the other side of the world, but here, in these United States of America, where you have fascists and white supremacists and Islamophobes reigning in the White House.\n\nThat statement is not a direct call for direct open war against the government. But it is a demand that Muslims recognize an obligation under Islam\u2019s jihad doctrine to unite in political opposition to a perceived enemy \u2014 the elected president of the United States.\n\nIn her own defense, Sarsour subsequently retweeted claims that Islam\u2019s jihad doctrine also endorses non-violent actions.\n\nResistance to oppression can be violent and non-violent struggle. Clearly, @lsarsour was talking about the latter. https://t.co/qSFOMVK6iB \u2014 Jamil Dakwar (@jdakwar) July 7, 2017\n\nSarsour\u2019s ISNA speech include numerous Koranic references that reinforce her demand for Muslim separatism.\n\nFor example, she said, \u201cyou can count on me every single day to use my voice to stand up, not only to people outside our community who are oppressing our communities but those inside our community who aid and abet the oppressors outside of our community.\u201d\n\nSarsour\u2019s repeated use of the term \u201coppressor\u201d evokes many verses in the Koran, which repeatedly urges bloody warfare against people who limit Muslims\u2019 power. For example, verse 2:193 in the Koran declares:\n\nFight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.\n\nSarsour\u2019s call for Islamic self-segregation instead of integration echoes statements in the Koran, which Muslims believe is the directed and unchangeable transcript of Allah\u2019s commands. For example, the Koran tells Muslims not to depend on non-Muslim authorities, but to unite as one Muslim \u201cummah\u201d against all non-Muslim powers.\n\n\u201cO you who believe ! Do not take Jews and Christians as your patrons. They are patrons of their own people. He among you who will turn to them for patronage is one of them.\n\nThe same verse is also translated as:\n\nO you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you \u2013 then indeed, he is [one] of them.\n\nMuslims must unite \u201cas one umma we are supposed to be,\u201d Sarsour said.\n\nShe also suggested to the Islamic leaders at her speech that opposition to Trump is an individual Islamic religious duty, or a \u201cfard al-ayn,\u201d by saying \u201cwhen the day comes that something horrific happens to us or to another community, you will be responsible for normalizing this administration.\u201d\n\nSarsour\u2019s frank demands for an Islamic political movement and for a self-segregated Islamic society in the United States echoes the broadly accepted strategy of self-segregation among Islamic activists in Europe and the United States. The separatist strategy is intended to grow their populations while shielding them from surrounding secular and Christian cultures, which Islamic believers see as profoundly illegitimate. For example, Sarsour repeatedly referred to \u201cthese United States of America,\u201d not \u201cThe United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic groups are also testing that strategy in the United States. For example, Islamic activists rejected Obama\u2019s so-called \u201cCountering Violent Extremism\u201d plan, which sought to reduce Islamic attacks in the United States by fostering counterterrorism cooperation with Islamic groups, including ISNA. But Islamic groups demanded more autonomy, including the legal authority to police their own co-religionists, in exchange for a promised reduction in domestic jihad attacks.\n\nBecause of that hostility, President Donald Trump\u2019s deputies have changed the nation\u2019s anti-jihad strategy. The new strategy emphasizes policing without reliance on cooperation from activists, such as Sarsour. The new strategy is based on the likelihood that the activist Islamic groups \u2014 such as ISNA and the Sarsour\u2019s groups \u2014 can be bypassed with effective outreach and cooperation with ordinary people \u2014- parents and employers, for example \u2014 who are part of the various Muslim neighborhoods and groups.\n\nDespite the media-magnified role of ISNA and various other Muslim political groups, it is not clear how much sway they have over Muslim Americans, many of whom rarely attend mosques and frequently drink alcohol. Sarsour\u2019s speech got a tepid response at the ISNA convention, partly because she insisted that the older Muslim leaders donate more funding to political activists, such as herself and like-minded firebrands, and also delegate more political power and visibility to younger, American-born Muslims.\n\nFollow Neil Munro on Twitter @NeilMunroDC"}

The Daily Express\n\nThe England-based tabloid ran an article titled \u201cWATCH: Polish president\u2019s wife SNUBS Donald Trump handshake \u2013 and darts for Melania.\u201d\n\nIn the piece, Joe Barnes writes:\n\nThe awkward moment was caught on camera as Ms Kornhauser-Duda appeared to snub the US president as she moved towards her US counterpart, Melania. The footage shows Mr Trump offering his hand to Ms Kornhauser-Duda, however, the first lady of Poland misses out the US President in favour for his wife. President Trump appeared to be bemused by the event as he goes from displaying a beaming smile to a frown within seconds.\n\nBarnes, however, never mentions that President Trump and first lady Kornhauser-Duda did eventually shake hands.\n\n4.

{"99": "Henry Olsen\u2019s The Working Class Republican: Ronald Reagan and the Return of Blue-Collar Conservatism is an immensely valuable book, not least because its insights are relevant to the current debate over health care policy.\n\nThe primary argument of the book is that Reagan was not the anti-government crusader that he is often remembered to be, but sought to protect Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal while dismantle Lyndon Johnson\u2019 Great Society.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOlsen makes a strong argument that Reagan believed government should support the needy, and that his main objection to the liberal welfare state was that it went much further than that, seizing power to serve the utopian visions of unelected bureaucrats, limiting Americans\u2019 potential for success.\n\nOlsen does not answer \u2014 nor, really, did Reagan \u2014 the question of whether the very existence of those government departments and programs leads to those statist excesses. Olsen\u2019s diagnosis of the causes of present-day Republican divisions is also inaccurate. He seems to blame the Tea Party movement for punishing deviations from conservative orthodoxy, though he does seem to acknowledge that it was the party establishment that launched the first shots after 2012, believing the party base had pushed Gov. Mitt Romney too far to the right on immigration.\n\nHe makes a comment, in passing, accusing Donald Trump of \u201cnot-so-veiled racialism and white nationalism,\u201d a claim he does not prove (and does not repeat). Yet Olsen\u2019s insights help explain why Trump attracted the same working-class voters that lifted Reagan to victory.\n\nOn Obamacare, Olsen says Reagan would have backed repeal:\n\nReagan would definitely have wanted to repeal Obamacare. Its rules and regulations put the government in the driver\u2019s seat in determining what care should be delivered, to whom, and at what price. This is exactly the sort of government-directed society that Reagan believed was opposed to American principles.\n\nHowever, he adds, Reagan also would have wanted to preserve parts of Obamacare:\n\nIt\u2019s less clear what he would have wanted to replace it with. I think, however, it is pretty clear he would have wanted to ensure that people would not lose coverage that they had received as a result of Obamacare\u2019s exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. His consistent belief that it was OK for government to pay for needed medical care for those who could not afford it makes that plain. The details as to who should be covered, how much the government should pay, and what level of care they would be guaranteed would be up for discussion, but I can\u2019t imagine that Reagan would be more concerned about money than about life.\n\nAbove all, Olsen argues, Reagan would have opposed an approach that placed conservative ideological goals ahead of what was best for ordinary people \u2014 for the \u201ctruckers and cashiers\u201d who lay at the heart of his political vision.\n\nJoel B.

{"101": "The Palestinians\u2019 decision to use the United Nations to claim Hebron\u2019s Tomb of the Patriarchs as their own heritage site is a direct slap to President Donald Trump, who is attempting to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\nEarlier this year, Trump decided to delay the long-promised move of the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, for fear of upsetting the Palestinians. But that did not stop the Palestinians from making their own move.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe idea that the Tomb of the Patriarchs is \u201cPalestinian\u201d is absurd. For thousands of years \u2014 long before Islam even existed \u2014 it has been among the holiest sites in Judaism, and also the oldest.

(The fourth matriarch, Rachel, is buried near Bethlehem.)\n\nThe title deed to the Tomb is provided by the Bible itself, in Genesis 23. Abraham insisted on buying the site, even though the owner was prepared to give it to him as a gift, precisely so that there would never be any confusion in the future about its ownership. Later, King David established his throne in Hebron (II Samuel 5), and Jews lived there for millennia until they were massacred in a 1929 pogrom, returning after Israel\u2019s victory in the 1967 war.\n\nThe Tomb is holy to both Muslims and Jews, and access to it is governed by a 1997 agreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Rather than building upon that agreement towards a broader peace, the Palestinians have violated the spirit of the Hebron deal. They are not only claiming the Tomb, and the city, as part of a future Palestinian state. They are also claiming the past as part of a mythical Palestinian heritage, displacing the Jews.\n\nThe Palestinians\u2019 move on Hebron is toxic to the peace process. But it also destroys any complaint the Palestinians might have against the U.S. moving its embassy to Jerusalem. Indeed, moving the embassy is suddenly an urgent priority, because the Palestinians clearly intend to continue advancing their claims in Jerusalem and elsewhere. The same UN body (UNESCO) that acted against Hebron last week has also denied the Jewish connection to Jerusalem.\n\nAs the Jerusalem Post warned Sunday, the resolution on Hebron is only the beginning of a Palestinian diplomatic assault against Israel that uses fabricated history and the UN\u2019s endemic anti-Israel bias to circumvent negotiations.\n\nThe Palestinians\u2019 move in Hebron comes as Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas has vowed never to end payments to terrorists and their families using U.S. taxpayer money, despite direct requests by President Trump and his emissaries. Clearly the Palestinians have no interest in compromise, nor do they fear the consequences of their provocative behavior, because thus far the U.S. and the world have been unwilling to punish them for it.\n\nMoving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem is a consequence the Palestinians would understand. It need not actually change the status of the city, since the western part of Jerusalem, where Israel\u2019s government is already based, is never going to be under Palestinian control, under any peace agreement contemplated thus far. But it would end, once and for all, the Palestinian and Islamist fantasy that all of Israel will one day fall under Palestinian rule.\n\nMoving the embassy would be a unilateral decision. But as the Palestinians\u2019 own behavior shows, they have no qualms about unilateralism. Ironically, they have given President Trump a perfect opportunity to fulfill his promise.\n\nJoel B.

{"102": "The head of Germany\u2019s Die Welt newspaper Ulf Poschardt has denounced the violence caused by left-wing extremists calling the rioting, \u201cthe new fascist violence of the left\u201d.\n\nMr. Poschardt, who serves as the editor in chief of Die Welt, slammed the so-called \u201cblack-block\u201d left-extremists in a new column likening them to the Blackshirts who committed acts of political violence under Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the 1920s.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cTheir black costume reveals that their aesthetic is inspired by Mussolini\u2019s black shirts. They act like fascists. They stir up fear and uncertainty. The Black Block has been turning Hamburg into a civil war landscape since Thursday evening,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cIn the run-up to the G-20 summit, there are always two kinds of protest: the one idealistic peaceful but over and over again \u2013 the hate-filled dream of a broken dystopia, as in the Batman movie \u2018The Dark Knight Rises\u2019,\u201d he added.\n\nCalling the members of the black-block, many of which are neither from Hamburg nor even Germany, \u201cadventure tourists\u201d Poschardt paints the average left-extremist as young men in \u201clate puberty\u201d who have, \u201cno more to offer politically than an archaic accumulation of rage and a regime of fear\u201d.\n\nThe problem with left-extremists has been building up for years according to Poschardt. He said that in the past police and authorities had made mistakes by \u201cconfusing squatters with homeowners\u201d, and allowing public spaces to be cleared of right-wing opinions by \u201cantifascists with their fascist love of power\u201d.\n\nAfter the left-extremist left 130 police injured and caused massive damage to property Thursday night, Poschardt points out the left wing Green party has placed the blame on the police. \u201cThis is grotesque in the face of the articulated threats of violence and a motto such as \u2018Welcome to Hell\u2019,\u201d he writes.\n\nThe Welt chief also notes the traditional idea of the left representing the working class is also largely a myth. He said that real working people were far more likely to be on the police side during a protest than the protestors who he describes as wearing expensive Northface jackets and \u201csneakers from the hipster shop\u201d.\n\nPoschardt is one of the few German media personalities to call out left wing extremism in such certain and blunt terms, though he has made controversial remarks in the past.

{"105": "It may as well have been written before President Trump even uttered a single word in Warsaw earlier this week, the Economist\u2018s panicked, hysterical, and un-bylined reflection on his speech that placed matters of identity, culture, faith and sovereignty over democracy.\n\n\u201cIn Warsaw, America\u2019s president barely mentions democracy,\u201d the article\u2019s sub-headline shrieks. For a magazine so fervently opposed to the results of the Brexit referendum (direct democracy in action), you could easily hurl accusations of hypocrisy at the magazine\u2019s editors.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInstead, we should be more wary of the ongoing fetishisation of the idea of one-man-one-vote as some kind of be all and end all of Western civilization.\n\nFirstly, in the grand scheme of all things European \u2014 and derivative nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia, etc \u2014 democracy is a relatively new concept. The cynic may well drop in this overused Churchill quote. Or this one. Again, too easy.\n\nIt strikes me as more important that we look at what the Economist is trying to achieve by declaring:\n\nWhen George W. Bush visited Poland for his first presidential visit, in 2001, he referred to democracy 13 times. When Barack Obama spoke in Warsaw in 2014, he mentioned democracy nine times. For Mr Trump, once sufficed.\n\nThe tone conveys hostility, not just towards those who do not believe the West is typified by more than the ballot box, but also to those who believe history matters, tradition matters, nation states matter, and identity matters.\n\nA refusal to deify democracy runs deeply contrary to the objectives of globalism, which explains the Economist\u2019s petulance.\n\nFor decades we have watched, almost stunned into inaction, as our children are forced to learn that patriotism is racist, and history is to be altered at the whim of the loudest, shrieking, protesters.\n\nMine isn\u2019t an anti-democracy argument either. Merely I want to reflect upon how the President struck the right balance between democracy and philosophy/history in his Warsaw speech.\n\nBut The Economist wants to give ahistorical progressivism \u2014 a tool often leveraged, even if not adhered to, by globalists \u2014 an intellectual underpinning. But there is no intelligence in this mantra. Quite the opposite.\n\nThe notion of putting democracy on a higher pedestal than tradition is anti-intellectual.\n\nConservatives and reactionaries are, today, less likely to be motivated by fear and emotion and more interested in learning lessons from the past that the left would rather ignore or rewrite.\n\nMany mistake the Economist for a pro-free market capitalist paper. Untrue.\n\nIt favours corporatism and cronyism. It isn\u2019t left or right per se. But it does favour the modern political centre-left, more interested in \u201cinternationalism\u201d, more in favour of the political establishment than the everyman. Hence its risible backing of the pro-European Union Liberal Democrats at the British general election.\n\nCurious, you might think then, that the magazine would side with the demos who elected President Donald J. Trump. Not so, either.\n\nPresident Trump won because of the electoral college, a check on a more direct democracy, and one which the Economist has previously sought to undermine in its U.S.-election coverage. Heaven forfend we suggest a return to the Senate\u2019s original role in not being a directly elected chamber either. That could really set their heads spinning.\n\nIt would be unfair however to state the paper misunderstands the idea of the tyranny of the majority. There have previously been printed warnings over referendums or ballot measures in the United States on their own pages. So what has changed since then, when in 2011, they published the following words:\n\n\u2026it is the \u201ctyranny of the majority\u201d that James Madison, a Founding Father, warned about. His reading of ancient history was that the direct democracy of Athens was erratic and short-lived, whereas republican Rome remained stable for much longer. He even worried about using the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d at all, lest citizens confuse its representative (ie, republican) form with its direct one. \u201cDemocracy never lasts long,\u201d wrote John Adams, another Founding Father. Asked what government the federal constitution of 1787 had established, Benjamin Franklin responded: \u201cA republic, if you can keep it.\u201d\n\nIn a word: Trump.\n\nIn another word: populism.\n\nThough JFK, Obama, and other centre-left politicians were swept into power on a populist wave, they represented the Wilsonian internationalism the Economist prefers. So they were okay. The same internationalism that loves democracy promotion abroad which led to the quagmire of the Iraq War: the reason we weren\u2019t able to stablise Iraq post-invasion. Our newfound obsession with putting a tick in a box.\n\nAgain, no grasp or reflection of this from the Economist as it lambasts the President of the United States for focusing on political philosophy rather than fawning over a system of electing a government.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t imagine editorialising such as: \u201cThe spectators, mainly conservative Catholics bused in from around the country and promised a free picnic at the defence ministry afterwards\u201d under an Obama presidency. In fact, these are the same tactics the left uses at elections as well as for protests and marches all around the Western world.\n\nOnce more, hypocritically, the paper takes a dig at the recently democratically elected Polish government:\n\nBut the greatest reason for Poland\u2019s government to be delighted with Mr Trump was what he did not mention: PiS\u2019s undermining of democratic institutions to entrench its own power. The party has stuffed the civil service and the diplomatic corps with loyalists and has weakened the independence of the judiciary. It has transformed the national broadcaster into a mouthpiece of the state. Independent journalists face new restrictions. The European Commission has warned the government that its reforms pose \u201ca systemic risk to the rule of law.\u201d\n\nOf course the (unelected, by the way) European Commission has said that. PiS has been steadfast in protecting Poland from the EU\u2019s migration madness, as well as taking steps to reassert Polish sovereignty.\n\nNever has the Economist mentioned how during the years the pro-establishment Civic Platform ruled, they too \u201cstuffed the civil service and diplomatic corps with loyalists\u201d. Their looting is one of the major reasons they lost to PiS in 2015.\n\nThe Economist wants to bash PiS and Trump; facts, philosophy, and even their own commitment to democracy be damned. If that means humiliating itself by performing anti-intellectual mid-air back flips in the process, it seems the editors are more than willing to do so.\n\nRaheem Kassam is the Editor in Chief of Breitbart London and tweets at @RaheemKassam"}

Neither Sanders nor Maddow are even mentioned in the piece.\n\nAccording to numerous news reports, Hodgkinson volunteered for Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign in 2016 and belonged to Facebook groups like \u201cTerminate The Republican Party\u201d in addition to others like \u201cExpose Republican Fraud,\u201d \u201cLiberal Democratic Socialist Party,\u201d \u201cBoycott The Republican Party,\u201d \u201cI Hate Donald Trump,\u201d and \u201cHealthcare & Education Berners United to Resist Trump.\u201d\n\nThe shooter also praised Maddow in a letter to a local newspaper that the radio host hates.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite TV shows is \u2018The Rachel Maddow Show\u2019 on MSNBC,\u201d Hodgkinson wrote in 2012 to the Belleville News-Democrat, which the radio host, according to the Post, refers to as the \u201cBelleville News Slime-o-crat.\u201d Hodgkinson also wrote in that note that on a recent episode of Maddow\u2019s show, \u201cshe stated that 17 very rich men are supplying the Republican Party with more than 60 percent of their campaign contributions.\u201d\n\nAt a local protest, according to the News-Democrat, he was also reportedly \u201cpart of a \u201999%\u2019 team drawing attention to the amount of money and political power the top 1 percent of Americans acquired.\u201d On the stump, Sanders often railed against the \u201c1%\u201d during the 2016 campaign.\n\nBefore he shot Scalise and three others while GOP lawmakers were practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game last month in Northern Virginia, Hodgkinson reportedly asked GOP lawmakers who were leaving the practice whether the players on the field were \u201cRepublicans or Democrats.\u201d He also reportedly had a list of Republicans that may have been a \u201chit list\u201d in his pocket.\n\nThe Post\u2019s article was so pointless that even a political editor from left-wing BuzzFeed tweeted, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of this?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shooter hated Trump and there\u2019s no indication in the story he listened to this pro-Trump host,\u201d the BuzzFeed editor tweeted.\n\nThis is yet another example of why nearly 70% of Americans, according to the latest Marist/NPR poll, do not trust legacy media outlets like the Post."}

{"113": "One day after U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson denied the state of Hawaii\u2019s motion to broaden the definition of \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d for refugees and visa applicants affected by Executive Order 13780, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals followed suit.\n\nIn its June 26 decision, the Supreme Court let stand the temporary travel and refugee ban contained in that executive order but added that the ban would not apply to refugees and visa applicants with a \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d to an American resident.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Trump administration quickly defined \u201cbona fide relationship\u201d as parent, child, sibling, spouse or fiance. The state of Hawaii wants a broader definition that would include grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and possibly more distant relations.\n\nLate Friday, the Ninth Circuit said no to Hawaii\u2019s request for an emergency appeal of Judge Watson\u2019s denial, saying it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.\n\nBut the liberal judges on the panel could not resist giving Hawaii a road map to get what they want.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit ruled that Hawaii should have asked Judge Watson to modify his previous injunction halting the Executive Order on March 15 (partially overturned by the Supreme Court on June 26) instead of asking for him to \u201cclarify\u201d the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.\n\nIn order to obtain a temporary partial victory in the matter, the state of Hawaii could now appeal the current 9th Circuit decision directly to the Supreme Court\u2013which could issue a ruling even though it is not in session if Justice Kennedy, who has that authority, chooses to act alone on behalf of SCOTUS.\n\nEach court of appeals is under the supervision of a justice. Kennedy is the circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit. One of the things a circuit justice can do solo is to stay any appellate decision from his circuit.\n\nAlternatively, it could follow the Ninth Circuit\u2019s advice, file a new motion with Judge Watson, and hope for a favorable ruling, which would likely be appealed by the Department of Justice to the Ninth Circuit, whose ruling would be appealed to the Supreme Court again by the losing party.\n\nMeanwhile, the Los Angeles Times reports: \u201cRefugee resettlement agencies say the State Department has given them updated instructions on President Trump\u2019s travel ban that extends the cutoff date for refugee admissions.\u201d\n\nWhen the ban was put into place last week, the administration said refugees who had booked travel would be admitted through Thursday. After that, immigration officials would block all refugees, except those who could prove they had U.S. connections, such as close relatives. The July 6 date was a government estimate of when the country would reach a 50,000-person cap on refugee admissions this fiscal year. Federal officials now estimate that the cap will be hit a week later, according to refugee groups. State Department figures show that 49,225 refugees had arrived in the U.S. as of June 30. A spokeswoman for the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration at the State Department would not confirm the change and said more information would come out Thursday.\n\nHIAS, one of the largest refugee resettlement agencies in the country and a plaintiff in the related IRAP v. Trump case that was also decided on March 15 and consolidated with the Hawaii v. Trump case that was wrapped into the June 26 Supreme Court decision, is aggressively seeking more refugees despite the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\u201cThe cap could be hit earlier, so it could be earlier than July 12,\u201d Mark Hetfield, the Chief Executive Officer of HIAS (formerly the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) told The Times.\n\nThe number of refugees arriving in the United States plummeted in the first week following the June 26 Supreme Court decision, though the subsequent four days between July 4 and July 7 saw the number of refugees increase by 578, which is about the daily rate seen in the previous eight weeks.\n\nAs of Saturday morning, July 8, according to the State Department website, 49,803 refugees have been admitted to the United States in FY 2017, which is 197 below the 50,000 ceiling President Trump set in Executive Order 13780.\n\nAt the current rate of refugee arrivals, that 50,000 ceiling will likely be reached on either Monday, July 10 or Tuesday, July 11."}

Seen from Trebisht, it is the gateway to Germany, England or some other promised land.\n\nAnd it suits Bulgaria to claim these people as their own.\n\n\u201cIt has to do with (Bulgaria\u2019s) policy on Macedonia/Macedonians who also have access to Bulgarian citizenship because they are seen as ethnic Bulgarians,\u201d said Southeast Europe expert Dimitar Bechev at the University of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cCommunities who live on the other side of the border\u2026 qualify as well.\u201d\n\nHe said Bulgarian MEPs have successfully lobbied the European Parliament to take a stand on the issue. \u201cIf Macedonia were an EU member, things would have worked another way, of course,\u201d Bechev told AFP.\n\nIn 1939, at the beginning of World War II, Bulgarians from 19 localities in Albania asked Sofia to defend their rights in what was then an Italian protectorate, according to the State Agency for Bulgarians Abroad.\n\n\u201cThe toponymy (study of place names), the preservation of an archaic Bulgarian language and the local dialect and traditions are evidence of the Bulgarian character\u201d in the regions concerned, Sofia says.\n\n\u2013 Illegal path \u2013\n\nTrebisht residents who said they consider themselves Bulgarian spoke to AFP in Albanian, but said they spoke Bulgarian at home with their families.\n\n\u201cI live in Albania,\u201d said the 60-year-old Gani Shahini, \u201cbut my origins are Bulgarian\u201d.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2016, a total of 4,470 Albanian nationals applied for a Bulgarian passport and 2,608 of them were successful, according to Sofia.\n\nBut these figures do not reflect the full extent of the phenomenon.

{"115": "President Donald Trump has created an \u201cOffice of American Innovation\u201d and an \u201cAmerican Technology Council\u201d to promote an America First economic policy. The head of the Council, Jared Kushner, hosted an event at the White House last month to promote technology week. Among the invited companies was one that did not fit in \u2013 the German tech company SAP.\n\nOn the official White House issues page on the website titled \u201cBring Back Jobs and Growth\u201d it states the following: \u201cWe will ensure that trade agreements bring good-paying jobs to our shores and support American manufacturing, the backbone of our economy. The President plans to show America\u2019s trading partners that we mean business by ensuring consequences for countries that engage in illegal or unfair trade practices that hurt American workers.\u201d Keeping jobs in the United States and not outsourcing jobs to foreign companies is part of President Trump\u2019s economic plan. That is why the inclusion of SAP was a head scratcher.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis White House Innovation Council is pushing for American innovation and technology. Some of the most successful foreign tech companies like Deutsche Telecom, Europe\u2019s largest internet provider, wasn\u2019t invited. Alibaba, China\u2019s most popular e-commerce site, and Amazon and eBay\u2019s largest competitor, was off the invite list too. Yandex, the Google of Russia, is another successful multinational corporation that was not invited. All of these companies are at least as successful, yet it was obvious that they were not proper invitees to a summit sponsored by the American Technology Council. For some unknown reason, the CEO of SAP, was not only in attendance, but he was lecturing White House officials on the need to outsource management software purchases to this German company.\n\nSAP is a company that provides software for business management and customer relations. USA Today reported that the CEO Bill McDermott attended the summit and his company put out a statement that read that the company \u201csupports the stated goals of the American Technology Council and its efforts to transform and modernize the federal government, and innovate how agencies use and deliver information.\u201d Other reports indicated that SAP pitched the summit on the U.S. government using the German produced software for government services.\n\nThe summit served a very important purpose because the U.S. government is living in the dark ages when it comes to use of technology. President Trump spoke of a \u201csweeping transformation\u201d in the federal government\u2019s use of technology. Apple\u2019s CEO Tim Cook argued that \u201cthe U.S. should have the most modern government in the world and today it doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s great to see the effort that Jared is putting in in working on things that will pay back in five and 10 and 20 years.\u201d That transformation should be with technology from Google, Microsoft, Apple and Oracle, not outsources to foreign competitors like Germany\u2019s Deutsche Telecom, China\u2019s Alibaba, Russia\u2019s Yandex and SAP.\n\nProtectionism is something that the tech community would like to avoid. It will lead to a trade war and other nations preventing American companies from providing technology and services abroad. A trade war would lead to countries walling off their economies from the world in a way where everybody would lose. That is an extreme way to push an America first economic policy.\n\nYet, another extreme idea is to use taxpayer money to purchase the services of a company wholly owned outside the United States with comparable technology made in America. The idea that the United States government would purchase the services of a foreign company when an American company does the identical function seems absurd.\n\nThe White House probably made a mistake in inviting a German technology provider to come to an \u201cAmerica First\u201d White House technology summit. Hopefully, as the White House offices of American Innovation and American technology don\u2019t outsource invitations to the next summit for other foreign companies."}

{"118": "Tesla\u2019s $57-per-share stock crash this week, after the company announced good news for the launch of its Model 3, seems even more justified with the release of Tesla\u2019s poor June U.S. sales figures.\n\nThe figures reveal that flagship Model S luxury sedan deliveries were down 37 percent from June 2016, and down 12.5 percent from June 2015.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBreitbart News reported on July 3 that Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla\u2019s first mass-market-vehicle had completed all National Transportation Safety Board qualifications, and a \u201chandover party\u201d would be held on July 28 to make 30 initial Model 3 customer deliveries. Musk stated that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 weekly production would ramp up to \u201c20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec.\u201d Musk also stated that Tesla is on track to meet its projected 80,000 deliveries in 2017 and 500,000 in 2018.\n\nThat should have been great news because Tesla has been losing about $30,000 on every car it produces, has never met a production schedule, and was only profitable in one quarter due to booking larger-than-normal government subsidies.\n\nBut the stock crashed because critics, who are closely watching Model 3 parts deliveries, estimate that Tesla\u2019s weekly production of Model 3\u2019ss would hit 30 in July; 250 in August; 1,000 in September; 1,875 in October; 3,250 in November; and 5,000 in December. That works out to delivering about 45,800 vehicles, or about half Tesla\u2019s 80,000-unit projection.\n\nThe critics had assumed that Tesla\u2019s June deliveries of its $100,000 Model S sedans and $140,000 Model X SUVs would rise by 20 percent over the prior year. But the authoritative Inside EVs blog reported that Tesla\u2019s Model S domestic deliveries for June plunged to 2,300 for 2017 \u2014 down from 3,700 for June 2016 and 2,800 for June 2015. Inside EVs reported that Tesla\u2019s Model X (which did not begin deliveries until late 2015) had June domestic deliveries of 2,200 for 2017, versus 2,145 for 2016.\n\nTesla has been delivering about the same number of foreign units per month as domestic units, so it could make a conceivable recovery of part of the delivery shortfall when the foreign numbers are reported around mid-month.\n\nMusk told shareholders on May 31 that Tesla engineers can increase production by 1,100 percent by employing \u201cphysics-first-principles\u201d to shape a new mode of industrial production that is \u201c10 or even 100 times\u201d more efficient than Detroit.\n\nMusk emphasized that the key advantage to increasing productivity for Tesla is limiting the number of moving parts in an electric motor to 20m versus up to 10,000 parts for an internal combustion engine. But Breitbart News reported 18 months ago that two-thirds of Tesla\u2019s electric motor drivetrains fail, and have to be replaced before vehicles reach 60,000 miles, according to Green Car Reports. Some Tesla owners have reported multiple replacements of drivetrains.\n\nBreitbart also reported in March that Tesla was being slammed by lawsuits from employees that complaining about racial discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\nDewitt Lambert filed suit claiming that he was continuously harassed in 2015 and 2016 by assembly-line supervisors and co-workers with a torrent of racial epithets, talk about the size of his penis, and an employee shoving a drill gun into his rear end. Lambert claims that despite the maltreatment, he was still expected to work 12-hour shifts for six days per week.\n\nAJ Vandermeyden, one of the only female Tesla engineers, filed a lawsuit in February and did interviews with the UK Guardian about alleged pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. Ms. Vandemeyden attended Tesla\u2019s diversity town hall on March 8, where numerous women complained about being discriminated against and harassed regarding wages, promotions, working conditions and too much overtime. Ms. Vandemeyden told the Guardian that the outpouring confirmed her complaint, and that Tesla then fired her for falsely alleging pervasive harassment against women.\n\nNone of this would seem helpful at increasing productivity by 1,100 percent. Breitbart News reported that the 10,000 employees at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, facility are only producing an average of 12 vehicles per employee, per year. That compares to an average of 74 when GM and Toyota managed the same plant two decades earlier."}

They loathe him so much they can\u2019t stand his constant winning.\n\nThe signs all over the city where the meeting took place, in the larger context of the G20 Summit, Hamburg, Germany, read: \u201cWelcome to Hell.\u201d\n\nOutside, the radical anti-capitalist protesters, mostly from the German violent Left, battled with the police (over 150 have been injured).\n\nWater cannons kept them at bay while the world leaders convened. Globalization was their stated enemy when it should have been globalism. Who funds all these wackos anyway; as they always show up again and again, accomplish nothing, except attempted disruption and continual news coverage, as if they were the story?\n\nThere were four myths that the media had projected around this first meeting between the Presidents, Trump and Putin, each of which needs to be defused and put to rest. They are all liberal gibberish:\n\n# 1 Myth is that the US and Russia are equals. The facts portray the true reality. The US economy is 20x times larger than that of Russias; and Russia is in decline as a still emerging economy, entirely dependent on the (low and getting lower) price of oil & gas. The US military spends $600 billion a year and the Russians spend only $67 billion. They are no match on the land, in the air, or at sea, except for one category: nuclear weapons. When it comes to cultural influence there simply is NO comparison.\n\n# 2 Myth is that the Americans hate Russians and vice versa. This is simply not true. We have in the past been allies, foes, and frememies and the fact that Russia deals in destabilizing measures is nothing new. As if America doesn\u2019t? This meeting disappointed the CNN crowd, as it was not the movie, Rocky IV, where Rocky Balboa took a wicked beating from Captain Ivan Drago until the last round. Russia and America it appears, surprise, surprise, can get along, can work together, can relate and even agree. Someone needs to tell all the costly and duplicative committees in the US Congress investigating\u2014who knows what?\n\n# 3 Myth international relations is not , regardless what the G20 or the UN, or god forbid, the EU says\u2014all about cooperation and a collaboration of multipolar weak powers to achieve next to nothing. In fact, Thucydides got it right centuries BC, when he stated: \u201cThe strong do what they can do and the weak suffer what they must.\u201d Life may no longer be quite the Hobbesian: short, nasty and brutish but it takes realpolitik and real leadership to get things done\u2014in war and peace. Trump and Putin seem to get that where other so-called \u2018world leaders\u2019 and the weak institutions they create \u2014 don\u2019t.\n\n# 4 Myth is simply that culture matters. Trump and Team America have read Russian culture. In the classic, Icon & The Axe, former Librarian of Congress, James Billington, argued that you can\u2019t understand Russia without knowing its history, literature, and culture, which is rooted in long suffering and the strong division between Europe and Asia. The Russian psyche is one of near constant lament and doom. Trump read this and allowed Putin a way to save face, be on a grand stage and solve world problems (many of which were indeed caused by Russia itself). He respected, perhaps, used Putin\u2014who we were warned beforehand was the dangerous, all too clever spymaster and brilliant chess player \u2014 to his own aims. In the end, it was Putin who got played.\n\nCan we finally get on now with treating Russia as a valuable nation state who has interests, some of which correspond with our own, some not, and start to deal with them as a player?\n\nPutin and Trump don\u2019t have to be best buds and a bromance was never really in the cards \u2014 only in the minds of the sorry, losing party and its media pawns. But as Henry Kissinger reminded us just weeks ago, \u201cDonald Trump is right about Russia\u2026 I hope that an effort will be made for a serious dialogue which tries to avoid the drift towards confrontation.\u201d\n\nYou see, Russia remains and always will be a riddle, wrapped in a mystery, as Churchill famously called it in 1939. But as he shrewdly went on to say, \u201cPerhaps there is a key. That key is Russian national interest.\u201d\n\nTrump has put America first but also realized that Russia needs to have air to breathe and scope to maneuver. It has a role in the game even if it is not quite yet welcomed into the Western civilized \u2018community of nations\u2019. That doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t call them out as he clearly did in Poland, or undercut them when it comes to providing alternative energy options to eastern and central Europe. It only means they can be useful when and where our interests intersect. No more, no less. And like the greatest diplomat to deal with the then Russian (Soviet) nemesis, Ronald Reagan insisted: \u2018trust but verify\u2019.\n\nLet\u2019s hope the following rounds in this US-Russia match can build on what was surely a solid start, reestablish a modicum of respect for each other and our duly elected leaders, and continue to debunk all four myths.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt Malloch is a diplomat and scholar whose memoir is entitled, DAVOS, ASPEN & YALE: My Life Behind the Elite Curtain as a Global Sherpa."}
{"120": "The elitist legacy media need more socioeconomic diversity, according to a journalist whose husband, who is a garbage man, worries that his blue-collar job will embarrass her when she socializes with other reporters.\n\nJournalist Heather Bryant, a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford, recently described a conversation she had with another journalist at a conference in which she was asked what her husband did for a living:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a truck driver and a mechanic.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, right now he drives for a trash company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat must be\u2026an interesting perspective to have around.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile they didn\u2019t explicitly say it, the person was very much thrown off by the nature of my husband\u2019s work. I was left with a very strong feeling they were expecting a more middle-class answer than a garbage worker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cJournalism has a class problem. We know this. The best internships are for students with the resources to work unpaid or with low pay in some of the most expensive cities in the country.\u201d\n\nBryant wrote that the journalist\u2019s surprised reaction made her wonder \u201chow badly our industry really lacks for people with more diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur journalism would be better if we were a better representation of the backgrounds and experiences our audiences have,\u201d she wrote.\n\nBryant\u2019s husband also seems conscious of the legacy media\u2019s elitism because he worries that he might embarrass her in front of other journalists.\n\n\u201cIf that conference interaction is how a journalist responds to my husband\u2019s job while idly chatting, how do they cover the sanitation worker that ends up in a story they are working on?\u201d Bryant asked. \u201cIf talking about someone to that person\u2019s spouse isn\u2019t enough to cause one to mask aversion, how do they talk about people to whom they feel even more distance from? What does this mean for our audience\u2019s ability to trust us?\u201d\n\nBryant then points out how when her husband goes on his garbage route in the liberal San Francisco Bay Area, he is treated the best in the \u201crougher neighborhoods and the working class areas\u201d while \u201cdisrespected\u201d and looked down upon in the wealthiest enclaves:\n\nThere\u2019s a recurring theme in the work stories he shares with me. His routes take him all over the Bay Area. Through the nice neighborhoods of the upper middle class and the extremely well off gated communities. Through the working class communities, the rougher parts of Oakland and the areas where the businesses are surrounded by the homeless. It\u2019s fascinating how people treat him based on only their knowledge that he is the trash guy. The vast majority of disrespect, rudeness and condescension happens in what many would call the nicer neighborhoods. Kindness and appreciation, people giving him a cold drink on a hot day or just saying thanks happens most in the rougher neighborhoods and the working class areas.\n\nBryan said that though her husband does \u201chave a four year degree,\u201d she would \u201cwager that he has a hell of a lot better understanding of people than some of the journalists that I know.\u201d\n\nBryant\u2019s piece indicates why so many journalists in the legacy media not treat working-class voters\u2014and the issues they care about\u2014with nothing but disdain and completely could not understand what motivated Americans who lived outside of their insular bubbles to vote for Trump in 2016.\n\nAs NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell recently acknowledged at the LA Press Club while receiving a lifetime achievement award, the legacy media were blindsided by President Donald Trump\u2019s victory.\n\n\u201cWe have to better,\u201d she reportedly said. \u201cWe never saw it coming.\u201d\n\nIt is worth noting that the late Tim Russert\u2019s father was a garbage man. And perhaps that is why, for all of his faults, Russert was better able to earn the trust of average Americans than most of today\u2019s smug and out-of-touch reporters in the legacy media."}

The investors initially showed great interest but after the release of the two regulations last week, they got cold feet,\u201d an anonymous owner of a danmei website told the government-controlled outlet.\n\nThe crackdown is part of a larger censorship system debuting last week. According to the Times, \u201cThe State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SAPPRFT) made public a guideline that says all online literary platforms will be assessed annually on an 100-point scale, of which 30 points will be dedicated to \u2018value guidance and style of thought.'\u201d\n\nAll works of fiction must now \u201creflect core socialist values and abide by moral norms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe regulation demands that up to 20 points be attributed to whether the platform has provided enough literary works that reflect core socialist values,\u201d the report added, noting that the grossest violations of \u201cvalue guidance\u201d would be any content that questions or challenges China\u2019s communist system (\u201cserious political error\u201d).\n\nSAPPRFT also unveiled a new initiative in which all movie theaters in China must screen communist propaganda before the beginning of films. Television outlets must now also broadcast at least seventeen \u201cpropagandistic drama series approved by the government\u201d each.\n\nWhile typically reflecting the Chinese government\u2019s party line and regurgitating belligerent state propaganda against the United States, the Global Times has printed comments from individuals referring to homosexuality as \u201cnormal and natural, if only present among \u201ca small group of people.\u201d That remark, from a sexologist, came in response to new online censorship from the China Netcasting Services Association (CNSA), which banned \u201cpornography and vulgar tastes including abnormal sexual relations such as incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse, as well as unhealthy views on marriage such as sexual freedom and wife swapping.\u201d\n\nCommunist dictatorships have traditionally abused the rights of their LGBT citizens, placing them in labor camps or executing them for their \u201ccounter-revolutionary\u201d behavior. China is no different; while there are no known statistics on the number of LGBT individuals killed or imprisoned under Mao Zedong, there is ample evidence of such abuse. China legalized homosexuality in 1997, but instances of \u201cconversion therapy\u201d abuses persisted.\n\nDanmei, the gay fiction genre in question in the Times article, consists of more than consensual adult gay activity, however. Many of the stories, the New York Times reported in a 2014 story on the genre, involve abuse of men and father-son incest; though a high percentage of danmei authors are women, few of the characters created are. Some fantasies in question, the New York Times cites a scholar explaining, are meant to subconsciously \u201csubvert the state.\u201d The same year this profile surfaced, the Chinese government arrested over twenty women for participating in writing gay fiction online.\n\nThe crackdown on danmei is part of a broader initiative by President Xi Jinping to suppress any organic expressions of Chinese culture that the government cannot control and replace it with \u201csocialist family values.\u201d In December 2016, Xi delivered a speech calling for a \u201cnew trend toward socialist family values,\u201d followed by a crackdown on dating television shows, online video that did not conform to \u201ccorrect political and aesthetic standards,\u201d and any media promoting \u201cWestern lifestyles.\u201d"}

{"126": "HAMBURG, Germany (AP) \u2014 The United States and Russia struck an agreement Friday on a cease-fire in southwest Syria, crowning President Donald Trump\u2019s first meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is the first US-Russian effort under Trump\u2019s presidency to stem Syria\u2019s six-year civil war.\n\nThe cease-fire goes into effect Sunday at noon Damascus time, according to US officials and the Jordanian government, which is also involved in the deal.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, who accompanied Trump in his meeting with Putin, said the understanding is designed to reduce violence in an area of Syria near Jordan\u2019s border that is critical to the US ally\u2019s security.\n\nIt\u2019s a \u201cvery complicated part of the Syrian battlefield,\u201d Tillerson told reporters after the US and Russian leaders met for more than 2 hours on the sidelines of a global summit in Hamburg, Germany.\n\nOf the agreement, he said, \u201cI think this is our first indication of the US and Russia being able to work together in Syria.\u201d\n\nFor years, the former Cold War foes have been backing opposing sides in Syria\u2019s war. Moscow has staunchly backed Syrian President Bashar Assad, supporting Syrian forces militarily since 2015. Washington has backed rebels fighting Assad. Both the US and Russia oppose Islamic State militants and say they\u2019re focused on rooting out the extremist group.\n\nThe potential pitfalls for the cease-fire are clear \u2014 not least the challenge of enforcing it.\n\nRussia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russian military police would monitor the new truce. But Tillerson said that was still being worked out. A senior US State Department official said the two countries were close to a deal on that issue and hoped to finalize it in the coming days, raising the prospect it could take effect Sunday with no clear sense of who is policing it.\n\nThat the deal was announced before all the details were ironed out was a clear indication of how eager the U.S. and Russia were to cast their leaders\u2019 first meeting as a success. Officials said the deal had been in the works for weeks or months, but came together in time for the meeting.\n\nThe deal marks a new level of involvement for the Trump administration in trying to resolve Syria\u2019s civil war.\n\nTrump ordered some 60 cruise missiles to be fired at a Syrian air base in April after accusing Assad\u2019s forces of a deadly chemical weapons attack. But his top military and national security advisers pointedly said they had no intentions of intervening to oust Assad. And they stopped short of endorsing Russian-led or UN peace mediation efforts between Assad\u2019s government and rebel groups.\n\nIsrael also is part of the agreement, one US official said, who like others wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. Like Jordan, Israel shares a border with the southern part of Syria and has been concerned about a spillover of violence as well as an amassing of Iranian-aligned forces in the south of the country.\n\nJordanian government spokesman Mohammed Momani confirmed the accord in a statement that made no reference to Israel\u2019s participation. Syrian government forces and its allies will stay on one side of an agreed demarcation line, and rebel fighters will stick to the other side. The goal is also to enable aid to reach this area of Syria, Momani told state media. US officials said the US, Russia and Jordan had only agreed on that demarcation line last week, clearing the way for a cease-fire to be worked out.\n\nThe deal is separate from an agreement that Russia, Turkey and Iran struck earlier this year to try to establish \u201cde-escalation zones\u201d in Syria with reduced bloodshed. The US, wary of Iran\u2019s involvement, stayed away from that effort. Follow-up talks this week in Kazakhstan were unable to produce agreement on finalizing a cease-fire in those zones.\n\nPrevious cease-fires in Syria have collapsed or failed to reduce violence for long, and it was unclear whether this deal would be any better.\n\nTillerson said the difference this time is Russia\u2019s interest in seeing Syria return to stability. It\u2019s an argument top US officials such as former Secretary of State John Kerry cited regularly amid his failed efforts to end a conflict that has killed as many as a half-million people, contributed to Europe\u2019s worst refugee crisis since World War II and allowed IS to emerge as a global terror threat.\n\nTillerson also repeated the US position that a \u201clong-term role for the Assad family and the Assad regime\u201d is untenable and voiced his belief that Russia might be willing to address the future leadership of Syria, in tones reminiscent of Kerry. Up to now, Assad has rejected any proposals that would see him leave power, contributing to an impasse that has prolonged Syria\u2019s suffering.\n\nEarlier in the week, Syria\u2019s military said it was halting combat operations in the south of Syria for four days, in advance of the new round of Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan. That move covered the southern provinces of Daraa, Quneitra and Sweida. Syria\u2019s government briefly extended that unilateral cease-fire, which is now set to expire Saturday \u2014 a day before the U.S. and Russian deal was to take effect.\n\nThe US-Russian cease-fire has no set end date, one US official said, describing it as part of broader discussions with Moscow on lowering violence in Syria.\n\nThe agreement may also reflect Iran\u2019s increasingly prominent role in Syria.\n\nWashington has been resistant to letting Iranian forces and their proxy militias gain strength in Syria\u2019s south, a position shared by Israel and Jordan. Friday\u2019s deal could help the Trump administration retain more of a say over who fills the power vacuum left behind as the Islamic State is routed from additional territory in Syria.\n\nIn recent weeks, US forces have shot down a Syrian aircraft that got too close to American forces, as well as Iranian-made drones. A renewed government offensive against Western-backed rebels and Islamic militants in the contested province of Daraa also is sparking tensions, and Iranian-backed Hezbollah fighters have shifted south to join the fight.\n\nIsrael has also struck Syrian military installations on several occasions in the past few weeks after shells landed in the Israeli side of the Golan Heights. Ahead of the deal, media reports in Israel have suggested unease at any arrangement that relies on Russia policing areas near its frontier.\n\nImplications for Syria aside, the deal marks the biggest diplomatic achievement for the US and Russia since Trump took office.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) enters the 2020 presidential race, the establishment media will be looking to Breitbart News to see how conservatives will attack her candidacy, according to Politico\u2019s California Playbook.\n\nCalifornia Playbook writers Carla Marinucci, David Siders, and Diamond Naga Siu pointed out on Friday that Harris has been garnering \u201ca flurry of will-she-or-won\u2019t-she, 2020-focused stories detailing her every move on Capitol Hill (and back in California).\u201d\n\nadvertisement\n\nThey then said Breitbart News is previewing where conservative media will go should Harris enter the 2020 race:\n\nRIGHT WING REVS UP: A preview of where the GOP, and the rightwing media, will go on Harris, should she ever begin serious efforts at a 2020 White House run. That first trip to Iowa hasn\u2019t been scheduled \u2013 but if or when it is, well, brace yourselves, Kamala fans:\n\nCalifornia Playbook then linked to a Breitbart News article about two veteran California journalists who ripped Harris for being a \u201cshallow\u201d and \u201cnarcissistic\u201d lightweight.\n\nIn that article, Breitbart News also pointed out that, \u201cDemocrats, especially operatives who may see her as a vehicle they can use to line their pockets or enhance their profiles en route to television contracts, have been hyping Harris as the party\u2019s next big star. \u201c\n\nThough Joel Pollak and Sam Chi at Breitbart California have kept tabs on Harris, those on the left and in the establishment media have been just as critical. This week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) seemed to tell Harris, in the words of ESPN\u2019s Lee Corso, \u201cnot so fast,\u201d when Feinstein told the New York Times, \u201cshe just got here.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she should do is concentrate on being a good, and possibly great, United States senator,\u201d Feinstein continued.\n\nTwo veteran journalists in Harris\u2019 home state recently wrote that Harris is a show horse who is taking \u201cbad advice from the craven whisperers around her.\u201d They said there is \u201cnot much there there,\u201d and Harris is just \u201cthe flavor of the week among the big grains in the Beltway.\u201d\n\nHarris Ain\u2019t The Next Barack Obama\n\nShould Harris somehow enter the 2020 race, she would need considerable support from black Democrats, especially in the South, who make up the heart and soul of the party\u2019s primary electorate.\n\nBut here\u2019s the inconvenient truth\u2014Harris has shown no indication that she can galvanize these important voters like Barack Obama did or Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) possibly can. In fact, she has not even shown to date that she could be as effective as John Edwards was.\n\nBefore Obama won his party\u2019s nomination, columnists like Stanley Crouch were questioning whether Obama, having grown up in fairly insulated Hawaii and abroad, understood the experiences of black Americans. In his 2006 column titled, \u201cWhat Obama Isn\u2019t: Black Like Me on Race,\u201d Crouch wrote that if the country ends up with the \u201cthe son of a white woman and an African immigrant\u201d as \u201cour first black President, he will have come into the White House through a side door \u2013 which might, at this point, be the only one that\u2019s open.\u201d\n\nObama, days before the anniversary of Bloody Sunday in March of 2007, went to Selma, Alabama and delivered a rousing speech. Obama, assuaging many establishment black Democrats who were skeptical of his fast rise, said then:\n\nSo don\u2019t tell me I don\u2019t have a claim on Selma, Alabama. Don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m not coming home when I come to Selma, Alabama. I\u2019m here because somebody marched for our freedom. I\u2019m here because y\u2019all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the Moses generation. But we have got to remember now that Joshua still had a job to do. As great as Moses was, despite all that he did, leading a people out of bondage, he didn\u2019t cross over the river to see the promised land. God told him, your job is done, you\u2019ll see it. You\u2019ll be at the mountaintop, and you can see what I\u2019ve promised, what I promised to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and I promised to you, you can see that I will fulfill that promise.\n\nBooker meanwhile, in addition to effectively using Twitter like Obama\u2019s squad used Facebook, has been giving passionate speeches in which he weaves in James Baldwin, William Lloyd Garrison, and Robert Smalls. He talks about the \u201cimpossible dream,\u201d recounts growing up in black churches, and describes how dogs were unleashed on his father and a volunteer real estate agent who was helping his family integrate a New Jersey neighborhood during his childhood.\n\nEven Edwards, in a seminal \u201csilence is betrayal\u201d address at New York\u2019s famed Riverside Church in which he apologized for supporting the Iraq War during the 2008 election cycle, appealed to the hearts of black voters better than Harris has done to date:\n\nAs he put it then, there comes a time\u2013not just for Dr. King, but for all of us\u2013when silence is betrayal\u2013not just betrayal of your own personal convictions, not just betrayal of your country, but a betrayal of our\u2013all of our joint responsibility to each other, to our brothers and sisters, not just in America, but all across the globe. \u2026 There does come a time when we have to each one of us refuse to wait for others to act\u2013a moment when we realize, as one of Dr. King\u2019s great teachers, Gandhi, said, we have to be the change that we want to see in the world. That time is here again. It\u2019s with us today. Dr. King taught us well. I believe, as I know many of you do, that it is a betrayal, a betrayal to stand silent and watch 37 million of our own brothers and sisters who literally worry about surviving, every single day. It is a betrayal to stand silent while the disparity between he rich and the poor gets worse and worse and worse, every single day in America, in the richest nation on the face of the planet. And I also believe that it is a betrayal not to speak out against an escalation of the War in Iraq.\n\nHarris, in the meantime, talks about \u201cfighting\u201d various policies, grandstands at Senate hearings, opposes Republicans taking away \u201cour stuff,\u201d and hurls F-bombs.\n\nAs Calbuzz\u2019s journalists noted, so far, there really isn\u2019t much there there."}

{"138": "Tesla\u2019s $57-per-share stock crash this week, after the company announced good news for the launch of its Model 3, seems even more justified with the release of Tesla\u2019s poor June U.S. sales figures.\n\nThe figures reveal that flagship Model S luxury sedan deliveries were down 37 percent from June 2016, and down 12.5 percent from June 2015.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBreitbart News reported on July 3 that Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla\u2019s first mass-market-vehicle had completed all National Transportation Safety Board qualifications, and a \u201chandover party\u201d would be held on July 28 to make 30 initial Model 3 customer deliveries. Musk stated that Tesla\u2019s Model 3 weekly production would ramp up to \u201c20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec.\u201d Musk also stated that Tesla is on track to meet its projected 80,000 deliveries in 2017 and 500,000 in 2018.\n\nThat should have been great news because Tesla has been losing about $30,000 on every car it produces, has never met a production schedule, and was only profitable in one quarter due to booking larger-than-normal government subsidies.\n\nBut the stock crashed because critics, who are closely watching Model 3 parts deliveries, estimate that Tesla\u2019s weekly production of Model 3\u2019ss would hit 30 in July; 250 in August; 1,000 in September; 1,875 in October; 3,250 in November; and 5,000 in December. That works out to delivering about 45,800 vehicles, or about half Tesla\u2019s 80,000-unit projection.\n\nThe critics had assumed that Tesla\u2019s June deliveries of its $100,000 Model S sedans and $140,000 Model X SUVs would rise by 20 percent over the prior year. But the authoritative Inside EVs blog reported that Tesla\u2019s Model S domestic deliveries for June plunged to 2,300 for 2017 \u2014 down from 3,700 for June 2016 and 2,800 for June 2015. Inside EVs reported that Tesla\u2019s Model X (which did not begin deliveries until late 2015) had June domestic deliveries of 2,200 for 2017, versus 2,145 for 2016.\n\nTesla has been delivering about the same number of foreign units per month as domestic units, so it could make a conceivable recovery of part of the delivery shortfall when the foreign numbers are reported around mid-month.\n\nMusk told shareholders on May 31 that Tesla engineers can increase production by 1,100 percent by employing \u201cphysics-first-principles\u201d to shape a new mode of industrial production that is \u201c10 or even 100 times\u201d more efficient than Detroit.\n\nMusk emphasized that the key advantage to increasing productivity for Tesla is limiting the number of moving parts in an electric motor to 20m versus up to 10,000 parts for an internal combustion engine. But Breitbart News reported 18 months ago that two-thirds of Tesla\u2019s electric motor drivetrains fail, and have to be replaced before vehicles reach 60,000 miles, according to Green Car Reports. Some Tesla owners have reported multiple replacements of drivetrains.\n\nBreitbart also reported in March that Tesla was being slammed by lawsuits from employees that complaining about racial discrimination and sexual harassment.\n\nDewitt Lambert filed suit claiming that he was continuously harassed in 2015 and 2016 by assembly-line supervisors and co-workers with a torrent of racial epithets, talk about the size of his penis, and an employee shoving a drill gun into his rear end. Lambert claims that despite the maltreatment, he was still expected to work 12-hour shifts for six days per week.\n\nAJ Vandermeyden, one of the only female Tesla engineers, filed a lawsuit in February and did interviews with the UK Guardian about alleged pervasive sexual harassment and discrimination. Ms. Vandemeyden attended Tesla\u2019s diversity town hall on March 8, where numerous women complained about being discriminated against and harassed regarding wages, promotions, working conditions and too much overtime. Ms. Vandemeyden told the Guardian that the outpouring confirmed her complaint, and that Tesla then fired her for falsely alleging pervasive harassment against women.\n\nNone of this would seem helpful at increasing productivity by 1,100 percent. Breitbart News reported that the 10,000 employees at Tesla\u2019s Fremont, California, facility are only producing an average of 12 vehicles per employee, per year. That compares to an average of 74 when GM and Toyota managed the same plant two decades earlier."}
