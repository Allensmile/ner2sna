{"0": "Garmin is serious. The most dedicated outdoorsmen and athletes look to its rugged products for tracking everything from laps in the pool to dangerous hikes in remote places. Now the company is getting more serious about heart rate with the $150 Vivosmart HR, its first wristband activity tracker with a builtin optical heart rate monitor that the company developed itself. It sports many of the features Garmin put into its other all-purpose trackers, including step, distance, calorie, and sleep tracking, smartphone notifications, and music and action cam controls. It all connects to the newly redesigned Garmin Connect app.\n\nOther than the heart rate monitor, there's nothing outstandingly new about it. However, the Vivosmart HR is a necessary product for Garmin. Not only will it compete with the forthcoming Polar A360, but, more importantly, it's going after Fitbit's $150 Charge HR with a comprehensive set of features that both novices and hardcore athletes will appreciate.\n\nDesign: Don't fix what isn't broken\n\nThe Vivosmart HR looks like a marriage of the Vivosmart band and the Vivofit 2. It has a module with a 1.00 x 0.42-inch,160 x 68-pixel touchscreen that sits atop the wrist, with a single physical button on the right side of it. It's embedded into a flexible, silicone band that mimics a regular watch strap, but this has rectangular notches rather than tiny holes. That subtle change makes it super easy to adjust and fasten, so you can make it as loose or as tight as you want depending on when you're wearing it (you'll want to have it on pretty tight when you plan on using the heart rate monitor heavily).\n\nOn the underside of the device is the optical heart rate monitor and the four tiny nodes for charging. The charging cable has an odd fastener on it that you have to fit the band into in order for it to power up via USB. The nodes are not magnetic either, so I often had to fiddle with the charging cable before I finally snapped it into place correctly.\n\nValentina Palladino The 160 x 68-pixel touchscreen is bold and has a backlight that turns on when you tap it. Valentina Palladino The 160 x 68-pixel touchscreen is bold and has a backlight that turns on when you tap it. Valentina Palladino The band is silicone and comfortable with an adjustable closure. Valentina Palladino The Vivosmart HR comes in black, blue, and purple. Valentina Palladino Swiping to the left on the display shows you steps taken, calories burned, and more. Valentina Palladino The heart rate screen shows you your real-time pulse and your average heart rate over time. Valentina Palladino Music controls for when you go on a run and don't want to whip out your phone. Valentina Palladino The settings menu, accessible by tapping the side button, lets you do things including start a run, enter do not disturb mode, and find your phone. Valentina Palladino The center icon initiates a sync with the Garmin Connect app. Valentina Palladino The nodes for charging, which surprisingly are not magnetic. Valentina Palladino The bottom of the module holds the optical heart rate monitor. Valentina Palladino The entire band isn't curved, but the module lays comfortably flat to your wrist. The charging cable for the Vivosmart HR acts like an awkward cradle for one side of the device. It's super annoying to snap into place, especially since the nodes are not magnetic. Valentina Palladino The display is also very easy to read in direct sunlight.\n\nDespite the display's basic, monochrome style, I really liked it. The numbers that show the time digitally are big and easy to read, and the entire display is super clear in direct sunlight as well. In the Garmin Connect app, you can choose if you want its blueish backlight on always, never, or only during activity and when tapped. I found myself wishing the backlight was brighter, but that's an issue most Garmin devices have had for ages. It also times out pretty quickly if you have it set to only turn on when woken by a tap or activity tracking, so I would suggest keeping it always on if you have eye troubles.\n\nThe Vivosmart HR is water-resistant up to 5 ATM, or about 50 meters. That's better than the comparable Fitbit Charge HR, which is only splash-resistant. The band is supposed to last up to five days on a single charge, and my band was down to about 20 percent battery during my fourth day of use.\n\nSetting up the device is simple enough: just download the Garmin Connect app and follow the pairing instructions after you sign in or create an account. The Vivosmart HR pairs via Bluetooth to your Android or iOS device, and it does so during setup from within Garmin's app rather than in the Bluetooth settings on your smartphone. I didn't have an issue setting up the device, but it did have occasional syncing issues. You can initiate a sync by opening up the app or by tapping the sync icon on the band; sometimes the band wouldn't automatically sync when I opened the app.\n\nA Garmin representative told me to update the Vivosmart HR's software to see if that would fix the problem. To do so, you must connect the device to your computer via its USB charger and sync it with Garmin Express, which you can download from Garmin's website. It's basically a device management system that is mostly good for software and firmware updates. Sure enough, my Vivosmart HR needed to be updated to the most recent software, and after I did so, it synced to the app quickly and easily. (I should also mention that Garmin was doing maintenance on its Connect app while I reviewed the Vivosmart HR. This slowed me down as it disrupted syncing, but after the maintenance was finished, things went back to normal.)\n\nFeatures: The usual suspects, with an accurate heart rate monitor\n\nGarmin is certainly trying to take Fitbit's Charge HR head-on with the Vivosmart HR. It tracks steps, calories, distance, floors climbed, and sleep, which is exactly what the Charge HR does. A note on sleep tracking: the Vivosmart HR monitors deep and light sleep, as well as the number of times you wake up each night. During setup, one of the things you have to tell the device is the time you typically go to bed each night and the time you wake up each morning. The tracker uses those times as guidelines. It automatically assumes you're asleep when it senses no movement in that window of time, and it also silences the vibration alerts on the band so any phone activity won't wake you up.\n\nOne of the new metrics tracked is \"intensity minutes,\" which piggybacks on the recommendation of organizations including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association that you should get at least 150 minutes per week of intense activity. According to Garmin's Vivosmart HR manual, you can gain intensity minutes by participating in \"10 consecutive minutes of moderate to vigorous intensity activities.\"\n\nThe biggest new feature is Garmin's Elevate optical heart rate monitor embedded in the wristband. It continuously monitors your pulse, learning your average heart rate over time. I like being able to check my heart rate at any time by swiping to the appropriate page on the display, and seeing my average heart rate puts the real-time number into perspective. I checked my pulse multiple times a day this way and tested the monitor's accuracy the old-fashioned way: taking my pulse with my finger over the artery in my throat. Each time the monitor was within 5 bpm of my reading.\n\nThe heart rate monitor is on when you work out as well, and the readings will show up when you swipe the display while tracking a workout. With runs, you can swipe through time, distance, calories, heart rate, and clock screens, and if you just want to be able to glance down at a specific metric while you're training, you can just swipe to that page and leave it there. Heart rate and distance are what I like to focus on when I jog, so I often kept the display showing those. I also like that when you stop tracking an activity, you can choose to save it or discard it\u2014this makes it super easy to filter out any activities that may have been interrupted for some reason or just ones you're not particularly happy with.\n\nThere's also broadcasting mode for the heart rate monitor, which shares your pulse with a connected Garmin ANT+ compatible device such as an Edge cycling tracker, the VIRB action cam (which you can also control via the Vivosmart HR), or even a Vivoactive smartwatch which can track swimming. Polar's upcoming A360 wristband can do the same thing, sharing your heart rate information with other Polar products that don't have monitors already in them.\n\nWhile the Charge HR shows you call and text alerts, the Vivosmart HR displays all the notifications your smartphone gets including texts, calls, emails, calendar events, Facebook, Twitter, and more. It's one of those bands that just floods your wrist with notifications, even if your smartphone doesn't light up with them. I don't disable any notifications on my iPhone 6, but some do not wake up the display because they aren't important enough for me to want to see immediately. Even those alerts come through on the Vivosmart HR, so often I would look down at my wrist and see just a random notification that a friend had checked-in at Shake Shack on Swarm. If you want to disable any notifications from coming through on the band, you'll have to go into the settings on your smartphone and disable them for your device as well.\n\nIn the drawer of miscellaneous features, the Vivosmart HR has music controls on its display, letting you pause and skip back and forth between songs while you work out. The only app I was able to use it in was iTunes, though, so Spotify and Google Music users are out of luck with this. If you've been slumming it on the couch or at your desk for over an hour, the band will vibrate to tell you to move a little. But the feature I used more than I'd like to admit is the find-my-phone feature: tap the phone icon in settings, and the band will send a jingle to your smartphone in case you've lost it."}

{"2": "We used to believe our brains couldn\u2019t be changed. Now we believe they can \u2013 if we want it enough. But is that true? Will Storr wades through the facts and fiction for Mosaic science.\n\nFor years she had tried to be the perfect wife and mother but now, divorced, with two sons, having gone through another break-up and in despair about her future, she felt as if she\u2019d failed at it all, and she was tired of it. On June 6, 2007 Debbie Hampton, of Greensboro, North Carolina, took an overdose of more than 90 pills\u2014a combination of ten different prescription drugs, some of which she\u2019d stolen from a neighbour\u2019s bedside cabinet. That afternoon, she\u2019d written a note on her computer: \u201cI\u2019ve screwed up this life so bad that there is no place here for me and nothing I can contribute.\u201d Then, in tears, she went upstairs, sat on her bed, swallowed her pills with some cheap Shiraz and put on a Dido CD to listen to as she died. As she lay down, she felt triumphant.\n\nBut then she woke up again. She\u2019d been found, rushed to hospital, and saved. \u201cI was mad,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d messed it up. And, on top of that, I\u2019d brain-damaged myself.\u201d After Debbie emerged from her one-week coma, her doctors gave her their diagnosis: encephalopathy. \u201cThat\u2019s just a general term which means the brain\u2019s not operating right,\u201d she says. She couldn\u2019t swallow or control her bladder, and her hands constantly shook. Much of the time, she couldn\u2019t understand what she was seeing. She could barely even speak. \u201cAll I could do was make sounds,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like my mouth was full of marbles. It was shocking, because what I heard from my mouth didn\u2019t match what I heard in my head.\u201d After a stay in a rehabilitation centre, she began recovering slowly. But, a year in, she plateaued. \u201cMy speech was very slow and slurred. My memory and thinking was unreliable. I didn\u2019t have the energy to live a normal life. A good day for me was emptying the dishwasher.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time that she tried a new treatment called neurofeedback. She was required to have her brain monitored while playing a simple Pac-Man -like game, controlling movements by manipulating her brain waves. \u201cWithin ten sessions, my speech improved.\u201d But Debbie\u2019s real turnaround happened when her neurofeedback counsellor recommended a book: the international bestseller The Brain that Changes Itself by Canadian psychotherapist Norman Doidge. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she says. \u201cFor the first time it really showed me it was possible to heal my brain. Not only that it was possible, that it was up to me.\u201d\n\nAfter reading Doidge\u2019s book, Debbie began living what she calls a \u201cbrain-healthy\u201d life. That includes yoga, meditation, visualisation, diet and the maintenance of a positive mental attitude. Today, she co-owns a yoga studio, has written an autobiography and a guide to \u201cbrain-healthy living\u201d and runs the website thebestbrainpossible.com. The science of neuroplasticity, she says, has taught her that, \u201cYou\u2019re not stuck with the brain you\u2019re born with. You may be given certain genes but what you do in your life changes your brain. And that\u2019s the magic wand.\u201d Neuroplasticity, she says, \u201callows you to change your life and make happiness a reality. You can go from being a victim to a victor. It\u2019s like a superpower. It\u2019s like having X-ray vision.\u201d\n\nDebbie\u2019s not alone in her enthusiasm for neuroplasticity, which is what we call the brain\u2019s ability to change itself in response to things that happen in our environment. Claims for its benefits are widespread and startling. Half an hour on Google informs the curious browser that neuroplasticity is a \u201cmagical\u201d scientific discovery that shows that our brains are not hard-wired like computers, as was once thought, but like \u201cplay-doh\u201d or a \u201cgooey butter cake.\" This means that \u201cour thoughts can change the structure and function of our brains\u201d and that by doing certain exercises we can actually, physically increase our brain\u2019s \u201cstrength, size, and density.\" Neuroplasticity is a \u201cseries of miracles happening in your own cranium\u201d that means we can be better salespeople and better athletes and learn to love the taste of broccoli. It can treat eating disorders, prevent cancer, lower our risk of dementia by 60 percent and help us discover our \u201ctrue essence of joy and peace.\" We can teach ourselves the \u201cskill\u201d of happiness and train our brains to be \u201cawesome.\" And age is no limitation: neuroplasticity shows that \u201cour minds are designed to improve as we get older.\" It doesn\u2019t even have to be difficult. \u201cSimply by changing your route to work, shopping at a different grocery store, or using your non-dominant hand to comb your hair will increase your brain power.\u201d As the celebrity alternative-medicine guru Deepak Chopra has said, \u201cMost people think that their brain is in charge of them. We say we are in charge of our brain.\u201d\n\nDebbie\u2019s story is a mystery. The techniques promising to change her brain via an understanding of the principles of neuroplasticity have clearly had tremendous positive effects for her. But is it true that neuroplasticity is a superpower, like X-ray vision? Can we really increase the weight of our brain just by thinking? Can we lower our risk of dementia by 60 percent? And learn to love broccoli?\n\nSome of these seem like silly questions, but some of them don\u2019t. That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s hard, for the non-scientist, to understand what exactly neuroplasticity is and what its potential truly is. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tremendous exaggeration,\u201d says Greg Downey, an anthropologist at Macquarie University and co-author of the popular blog Neuroanthropology. \u201cPeople are so excited about neuroplasticity they talk themselves into believing anything.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cscience of the future\u201d\n\nFor many years, the consensus was that the human brain couldn\u2019t generate new cells once it reached adulthood. Once you were grown, you entered a state of neural decline. This was a view perhaps most famously expressed by the so-called founder of modern neuroscience, Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. After an early interest in plasticity, he became sceptical, writing in 1928, \u201cIn adult centres the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the future to change, if possible, this harsh decree.\u201d Cajal\u2019s gloomy prognosis was to rumble through the 20th century.\n\nAlthough the notion that the adult brain could undergo significant positive changes received sporadic attention, throughout the 20th century, it was generally overlooked, as a young psychologist called Ian Robertson was to discover in 1980. He\u2019d just begun working with people who had had strokes at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh and found himself puzzled by what he was seeing. \u201cI\u2019d moved into what was a new field for me, neuro-rehabilitation,\u201d he says. At the hospital, he witnessed adults receiving occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Which made him think\u2026 if they\u2019d had a stroke, that meant a part of their brain had been destroyed. And if a part of their brain had been destroyed, everyone knew it was gone for ever. So how come these repetitive physical therapies so often helped? It didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cI was trying to get my head around, what was the model?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat was the theoretical basis for all this activity here?\u201d The people who answered him were, by today\u2019s standards, pessimistic.\n\n\u201cTheir whole philosophy was compensatory,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cThey thought the external therapies were just preventing further negative things happening.\u201d At one point, still baffled, he asked for a textbook that explained how it all was supposed to work. \u201cThere was a chapter on wheelchairs and a chapter on walking sticks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was nothing, absolutely nothing, on this notion that the therapy might actually be influencing the physical reconnection of the brain. That attitude really went back to Cajal. He really influenced the whole mindset which said that the adult brain is hardwired, all you can do is lose neurons, and that if you have brain damage all you can do is help the surviving parts of the brain work around it.\u201d\n\nBut Cajal\u2019s prognosis also contained a challenge. And it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the \u201cscience of the future\u201d first began to rise to it. Two stubborn pioneers, whose tales are recounted so effectively in Doidge\u2019s bestseller, were Paul Bach-y-Rita and Michael Merzenich. Bach-y-Rita is perhaps best known for his work helping blind people \u2018see\u2019 in a new and radically different way. Rather than receiving information about the world from the eyes, he wondered if they could take it in in the form of vibrations on their skin. They\u2019d sit on a chair and lean back on a metal sheet. Pressing up against the back side of that metal sheet were 400 plates that would vibrate in accord with the way an object was moving. As Bach-y-Rita\u2019s devices became more sophisticated (the most recent version sits on the tongue), congenitally blind people began to report having the experience of \u2018seeing\u2019 in three dimensions. It wasn\u2019t until the advent of brain-scanning technology that scientists began to see evidence for this incredible hypothesis: that information seemed to be being processed in the visual cortex. Although this hypothesis is yet to be firmly established, it seems as if their brains had rewired themselves in a radical and useful way that had long been thought impossible.\n\nMerzenich, meanwhile, helped to confirm in the late 1960s that the brain contains \u2018maps\u2019 of the body and the outside world, and that these maps have the ability to change. Next, he co-developed the cochlear implant, which helped deaf people hear. This relies on the principle of plasticity, as the brain needs to adapt to receive auditory information from the artificial implant instead of the cochlea (which, in the deaf person, isn\u2019t working). In 1996 he helped establish a commercial company that produces educational software products called Fast ForWord for \u201cenhancing the cognitive skills of children using repetitive exercises that rely on plasticity to improve brain function,\u201d according to their website. As Doidge writes, \u201cIn some cases, people who have had a lifetime of cognitive difficulties get better after only thirty to sixty hours of treatment.\u201d\n\nAlthough it took several decades, Merzenich and Bach-y-Rita were to help prove that Cajal and the scientific consensus were wrong. The adult brain was plastic. It could rewire itself, sometimes radically. This came as a surprise to experts like Robertson, now a Director of Trinity College Dublin\u2019s Institute of Neuroscience. \u201cI can look back on giving lectures at Edinburgh University to students where I gave wrong information, based on the dogma which said that, once dead, a brain cell cannot regenerate and plasticity happens in early childhood but not later,\u201d he says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the publication of a series of vivid studies involving brain scans that this new truth began to be encoded into the synapses of the masses. In 1995, neuropsychologist Thomas Elbert published his work on string players that showed the \u2018maps\u2019 in their brain that represented each finger of the left hand\u2014which they used for fingering\u2014were enlarged compared to those of non-musicians (and compared to their own right hands, not involved in fingering). This demonstrated their brains had rewired themselves as a result of their many, many, many hours of practice. Three years later, a Swedish\u2013American team, led by Peter Eriksson of Sahlgrenska University Hospital, published a study in Nature that showed, for the very first time, that neurogenesis\u2014the creation of new brain cells\u2014was possible in adults. In 2006, a team led by Eleanor Maguire at the Institute of Neurology at University College London found that the city\u2019s taxi drivers have more grey matter in one hippocampal area than bus drivers, due to their incredible spatial knowledge of London\u2019s maze of streets. In 2007, Doidge\u2019s The Brain that Changes Itself was published. In its review of the book, the New York Times proclaimed that \u201cthe power of positive thinking has finally gained scientific credibility.\" It went on to sell over one million copies in over 100 countries. Suddenly, neuroplasticity was everywhere.\n\nListing image by Brea Souders at East Photographic"}
{"3": "The LHC was primarily designed as a particle discovery machine. It has already spotted the Higgs boson, and the hope is that its upgrade to higher energies will allow it to uncover more. But each LHC run is capped off by a period of experimentation that has as much to do with cosmology as particle physics.\n\nNormally, the quarks and gluons that make up most of familiar matter come bundled in discrete packages like protons and neutrons. But increase the energy and density enough, and you reach conditions similar to those of the Universe a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Here, the boundaries of these discrete particles break down, and something called a quark-gluon plasma forms.\n\nStudy of the quark-gluon plasma was pioneered at Brookhaven National Lab's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, or RHIC. There, gold atoms are stripped of their electrons and accelerated to high energies. When they collide, their protons and neutrons break down to form the plasma, and researchers can study it by tracking the particles that fly out of it.\n\nNormally, CERN's Large Hadron Collider smashes individual protons together. But each year, CERN uses it as a giant version of RHIC by accelerating lead ions. Because lead ions have 82 protons, it's much easier to accelerate and steer them. As a result, the collisions are much higher energy; while the protons topped out at just under 14 Tera-electronVolts, the lead atoms will be colliding at over 1 Peta-electronVolt.\n\nOr, rather, are colliding. CERN announced that data from the first lead ion collisions was obtained this morning, local time.\n\nSo far, at lower energies, the LHC has largely extended the discoveries made at RHIC. But there's always a chance that new behavior will become apparent at higher energies, and the upgraded LHC is definitely providing a big boost in the energy department."}
{"4": "It is a nightmare glacier, tormented by the giant of our Solar System ever looming on its horizon.\n\nJupiter showers its moon Europa with enough radiation to kill a human in just a few days. Europa must also contend with the massive planet\u2019s powerful tidal forces. The moon literally creaks as Jupiter\u2019s bulk rends its frozen surface in deep crevasses, pushing and pulling the ice upward and downward by tens of meters every few days. And with only a very tenuous atmosphere, it is so very cold: -210 degrees Celsius.\n\nYet as forbidding as Europa\u2019s surface may be, just a few kilometers below lies the largest ocean in the known Universe. It dwarfs any on Earth, encircling the entire moon and plunging as far as 100 kilometers deep. The tidal forces that wrench Europa's icy surface also tug on the core of this ocean, dissipating heat and providing ample energy to warm the ocean.\n\nOutside of Earth, many astrobiologists say Europa\u2019s vast, dark ocean probably offers the best hope for finding life elsewhere in the Solar System. For these scientists, Europa beckons like the sirens of a Homeric epic.\n\nLanding on a nightmare\n\nNASA is very publicly planning a mission to Europa in the 2020s, one that will soar over the intriguing moon dozens of times. Yet the reality is more thrilling. Quietly, the same engineers who masterminded the daring Curiosity landing on Mars in 2012 have been plotting how best to drop a lander onto the nightmare glacier. In early November, they presented their preliminary findings for a 230-kg lander to the one person in the world who can, and who dearly wants to, make that happen.\n\n\u201cI told them to do whatever it takes,\u201d said Representative John Culberson after meeting with the NASA scientists. \u201cAll of humanity is going to want to know what\u2019s under the ice.\u201d\n\nA God-fearing, cowboy-boot wearing conservative Texas Republican, Culberson is far from a household name. But as chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of NASA\u2019s budget, he has the final say on the agency\u2019s budget in the House. As much as anything else he has ever wanted in his life, Culberson yearns for NASA to land on Europa. And with the federal purse in hand, he\u2019s doing everything possible to make it happen.\n\nCulberson isn\u2019t the first to fall under the moon\u2019s spell. In Greek mythology, Zeus, the Greek counterpart to the Roman god Jupiter, abducted the Phoenician princess Europa and made her the queen of Crete. The moon is named after her. In the seminal science fiction series Space Odyssey, novelist Arthur C. Clarke recognized Europa\u2019s special place in the Solar System. At the end of the series\u2019 second novel, 2010: Odyssey Two, a ship sent to Jupiter appears to receive a message from aliens: \u201cAll these worlds are yours except Europa. Attempt no landing there.\u201d\n\nSorry HAL, we\u2019re going. It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more compelling mission for NASA in the next 10 to 15 years than the exploration of Europa. NASA touts its human \u201cJourney to Mars,\u201d but in reality the most astronauts will accomplish by the mid-2020s is a repeat of the Apollo 8 flight around the Moon, which already happened in 1968. Likewise, while Curiosity awed the world, it was the eighth probe NASA has successfully landed on Mars. Cold, dry, and probably lifeless today, Mars no longer seems all that exotic.\n\nEuropa, by contrast, is undiscovered country. NASA last visited the Jupiter system in the 1990s and early 2000s with the Galileo spacecraft. Galileo snapped images of Europa during 11 flybys, but everything about those photos ended up limited. The best of those pictures had a resolution of only about 10 meters per pixel. The spacecraft stored those images on a tape recorder with a capacity of 114 megabytes, but a flawed rewind mode hampered even that modest device. Additionally, Galileo\u2019s closest approach to Europa brought the probe only to within about 200 km of the moon\u2019s surface.\n\nNASA/JPL/DLR A false-color composite image of Europa.

The diameter of the central dark spot, ejecta blasted from beneath Europa's surface, is approximately 40km, and bright white rays extend for over a thousand kilometers in all directions from the impact site. These rays cross over many different terrain types, indicating that they are younger than anything they cross. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona View of a small region of the thin, disrupted, ice crust in the Conamara region showing the interplay of surface color with ice structures. The white and blue colors outline areas that have been blanketed by a fine dust of ice particles ejected at the time of formation of the large crater Pwyll some 1,000 km to the south. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This synthetic color image shows three distinct spectral units. The bright white areas are ejecta rays from the relatively young crater Pwyll, located about 1,000 km to the south. Also visible are reddish areas that can be seen along the ridges, in the region of disrupted terrain in the center of the image and near the dome-like features where the surface may have been thermally altered. Thus, areas associated with internal geologic activity appear reddish. The third distinct color unit is bright blue and corresponds to the relatively old icy plains. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona A close-up of Thera and Thrace, two reddish regions that disrupt the older icy ridged plains. Thera (left) is about 70 kilometers wide by 85 kilometers high and appears to lie slightly below the level of the surrounding plains. Thrace is longer, shows a hummocky texture, and appears to stand at or slightly above the older surrounding bright plains. One model for the formation of these and other chaos regions on Europa is complete melt-through of Europa's icy shell from an ocean below. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This image compares the size of Europa's ice rafts with a similarly scaled photo of the California Bay Area. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This mosaic of the Conamara Chaos region clearly indicates relatively recent resurfacing of Europa's surface. Irregularly shaped blocks of water ice were formed by the breakup and movement of the existing crust. The blocks were shifted, rotated, and even tipped and partially submerged within a mobile material that was either liquid water, warm mobile ice, or an ice and water slush. The presence of young fractures cutting through this region indicates that the surface froze again into solid, brittle ice. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This view of the Conamara Chaos region shows cliffs along the edges of high-standing ice plates. The washboard texture of the older terrain has been broken into plates which are separated by material with a jumbled texture. The cliffs themselves are rough and broadly scalloped, and smooth debris shed from the cliff faces is piled along the base. The height of the cliffs and size of the scalloped indentations are comparable to the famous cliff face of Mount Rushmore. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This composite image shows the distribution of ice and minerals for the structure named Tyre, the largest and likely one of the oldest on the moon. Tyre, at 140km diameter is the size of the island of Hawaii and thought to be the site where an asteroid or comet impacted Europa's ice crust. The blue in this image indicates areas with higher concentrations of mineral salts. These salts are similar in composition to those found in the bottom of Death Valley, California. The yellow-orange regions are areas that have a high surface abundance of water ice. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona False color has been used here to enhance the visibility of certain features of the Minos Linea region. Triple bands, lineae, and mottled terrains appear in brown and reddish hues, indicating the presence of contaminants in the ice. The icy plains, shown here in bluish hues, subdivide into units with different albedos at infrared wavelengths probably because of differences in the grain size of the ice. NASA/JPL/University of Arizona This is the highest resolution image of Europa at 6 meters per picture element. The image was taken at a highly oblique angle, providing a vantage point similar to that of someone looking out an airplane window, albeit 500km high. The features at the bottom of the image are much closer to the viewer than those at the top of the image.\n\nDespite all of this, Europa dazzled, and Galileo confirmed that a large ocean must exist beneath the moon\u2019s icy shell. The spacecraft\u2019s tantalizing findings left scientists grasping for more. During the most recent \u201cdecadal survey\u201d published in 2011, a document in which the scientific community sets priorities for planetary explanation, a mission to return a sample Martian soil and a Europa orbiter were rated as the two highest priorities."}

The story has been slightly updated.\n\nFurther Reading Explaining the \u201cUSB 3.1 Gen 1\u201d port in the Retina MacBook Not all USB 3.1 ports are created equal, as the new laptop shows.\n\nLike all technology, USB has evolved over time. Despite being a \u201cUniversal\u201d Serial Bus, in its 18-or-so years on the market it has spawned multiple versions with different connection speeds and many, many types of cables.\n\nThe USB Implementers Forum, the group of companies that oversees the standard, is fully cognizant of this problem, which it wants to solve with a new type of cable dubbed Type-C. This plug is designed to replace USB Type-A and Type-B ports of all sizes on phones, tablets, computers, and other peripherals. Type-C will support the new, faster 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2 spec with room to grow beyond that as bandwidth increases.\n\nIt's possible that in a few years, USB Type-C will have become the norm, totally replacing the tangled nest of different cables that we all have balled up in our desk drawers. For now, it\u2019s just another excuse to pass around that dog-eared XKCD comic about the proliferation of standards. While we wait to see whether Type-C will save us from cable hell or just contribute to it, let\u2019s take a quick look at where USB has been over the years, what competing standards it has fought against, and what technologies it will continue to grapple with in the future.\n\nWhat it replaced\n\nIf you've only been using computers for the last decade or so, it can be easy to take USB for granted. But for all of its ever-shifting specs and connectors, it's still a huge improvement over what came before.\n\nIf you were using a computer any time before the dawn of USB in the Pentium and Pentium II eras, connecting pretty much anything to your computer required any one of a large variety of ports. Connecting a mouse? Maybe you need a PS/2 connector or a serial port. A keyboard? PS/2 again, maybe the Apple Desktop Bus, or a DIN connector. Printers and scanners generally used big old parallel ports, and you could also use them for external storage if you didn't want to use SCSI. Connecting gamepads or joysticks to your computer often required a game port, which by the '90s was commonly found on dedicated sound cards (these were the days before audio chips became commonplace on desktop and laptop motherboards).\n\nYou can see the problem. Some of these ports required their own dedicated expansion cards, they all took up a bunch of space, and they were often fussy when it came time to configure or troubleshoot them. By the late '90s, computers were starting to come with a couple of USB ports, usually a couple of them on the back of the system\u2014these were usually USB 1.1 ports, capable of speeds up to 12Mbps (or 1.5Mbps for peripherals like keyboards and mice). Accessory makers didn't all make the switch to USB right away, but keyboards, mice, printers, and other accessories began to include USB ports and connectors as an option, then as the primary interface.\n\nWhen USB 2.0 became more widespread in the early-to-mid 2000s, it began to replace even more things. USB flash drives had a hand in the death of the floppy disk (and proprietary relatives like the Zip drive), and in the slow fade of optical media\u2014why use CDs and DVDs for data storage and operating system install media when smaller, faster, more versatile USB drives can get the job done more quickly? USB 2.0 also made it feasible to connect external peripherals\u2014like Wi-Fi adapters, optical drives, Ethernet ports, and so on\u2014that previously needed to be installed inside the computer. Transfer speeds of up to 480Mbps helped make all of this possible, and in this era USB ports began to multiply and completely replace older legacy ports on desktops and (especially) laptops. It was pretty common to find four or more USB ports on the back of desktops, as well as one or two more mounted on the front for easy access.\n\nUSB really came of age with USB 2.0, and USB 3.0's increase in speeds to 5Gbps has made it even more useful for all of the use cases mentioned above\u2014it takes less time to perform system backups or to move giant video files around, and it relieves a bottleneck for 802.11ac or gigabit Ethernet adapters. It's relatively comfortable to run entire operating systems from USB 3.0 hard drives or flash drives, especially useful if you're trying to troubleshoot a machine or recover data from it. USB ports are often the only ports available on laptops, especially since Wi-Fi has reduced the need for dedicated Ethernet ports. The ubiquity of the interface guarantees support from all major chipmakers, from Intel to Qualcomm to AMD. (Intel's current chipsets support a total of 14 USB ports, a far cry from the two-ish that were usually available on early systems.)\n\nIn other words, USB isn't without its problems, but it's managed to gain and keep wide support from technology companies, and the basic USB Type-A connector found on most computers has stayed the same size and shape for close to 20 years. Considering the patchwork of interfaces it came to replace, that's no small feat."}
{"6": "On Nov. 4, 2010, a small cell of al-Qaeda operatives convened at a Starbucks in Corvallis, Oregon, to review the details of their plot to kill 25,000 people in downtown Portland. The cell had three members: Hussein, an explosives expert; Youssef, a businessman turned jihadi recruiter; and Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a 19-year-old Somali-American college student.\n\nThe would-be terrorists had met earlier that year, after one of Mohamud\u2019s friends from the mosque recommended him to the Council, a secret jihadi organization that scoured the globe for potential operators. Hussein and Youssef flew to Oregon to meet the teen, whom they called \u201ca jewel in the rough.\u201d Together, the three conceived a plot to detonate an 1,800-pound bomb during Portland\u2019s Christmas tree lighting ceremony, a yearly Black Friday tradition in Pioneer Square, the city\u2019s main plaza. Mohamud chose the target. Hussein and Youssef designed and built the bomb.\n\nIt was time for a test run. After meeting at the coffee shop, the group drove to a remote spot in the countryside. There, Hussein showed Mohamud a smaller version of the device: a backpack filled with three pounds of explosives. They placed the bomb in a tree and walked away. Hussein handed Mohamud a cell phone and asked him to dial a number. The teenager obeyed \u2014 and a small explosion rattled the last yellow leaves on the trees.\n\nLater that day, the cell returned to Mohamud\u2019s apartment in Corvallis to record his farewell video. The teenager put on a white robe, a white-and-red headdress, and a camouflage jacket. He began to read his manifesto to the camera. \u201cFor as long as you threaten our security, your people will not remain safe,\u201d Mohamud said. \u201cAs your soldiers target our civilians, we will not fail to do so. Did you think that you could invade a Muslim land and we would not invade you?\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on Nov. 26, 2010, Youssef picked up Mohamud from a friend\u2019s house in Portland. They met with Hussein and headed to a parking spot near the Comcast building, where the operators showed Mohamud a large white van. Hussein opened the side door, revealing six 55-gallon drums filled with fertilizer. On the front seat was the detonation mechanism: a cell phone, a 9-volt battery, and a switch. The whole van smelled of diesel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\nThe three headed to a hotel in downtown Portland, where they prayed and ordered a pizza. They turned on the TV and watched the crowds march into Pioneer Square under light rain.\n\nAround sunset, Hussein and Mohamud drove the bomb to the chosen corner. Mohamud flipped the toggle switch attached to the detonator, arming the bomb. Youssef picked up Mohamud and Hussein in a different car and drove them to Union Station. As the three left the scene, Mohamud said he thought he saw his mother heading toward the ceremony.\n\nAfter dropping off Youssef at the train station, Hussein and Mohamud parked in a nearby garage. The explosives expert handed the teen a cell phone. The teenager dialed the detonator number. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get out of the car and try again?\u201d Hussein said.\n\nMohamud did as he was told. As he pressed the last button, he heard a group of people running at him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d someone yelled.\n\nSuddenly, Mohamud was on the ground. He could hear Hussein screaming, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d \u2014 God is great \u2014 over and over again. After the third or fourth time, the 17 arresting officers started to laugh.\n\nThe bomb Mohamud had tried to detonate was fake. The test explosion was staged. There was no secret council of militant leaders seeking a gifted Somali-American teenager to wage jihad. Youssef and Hussein were undercover FBI agents.\n\nID: 7350053\n\nThe Black Friday non-bombing of Portland was a federal government sting, the result of a yearlong operation involving dozens of people, a secret court order, and a massive surveillance apparatus.\n\n\n\nMohamud\u2019s mugshot. Multnomah County Sheriff Office via Getty Images ID: 7340213\n\nMohamud went to trial three years after his arrest. (Unless otherwise stated, the facts in this article come from the voluminous public record for his criminal case, including the 2,700-page trial transcript, as well as firsthand interviews with 11 people with knowledge of the case. The FBI, the Department of Justice, and Mohamud\u2019s attorneys declined to answer detailed questions. Mohamud did not respond to letters sent to him in prison.)\n\nIn court, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers attempted an entrapment defense, arguing that their client never indicated he wanted to attack Portland before the FBI contacted him. The prosecution said Mohamud\u2019s prior correspondence with two individuals suspected of working for al-Qaeda was evidence he was looking for \u201cthe right people\u201d \u2014 and that, had the FBI not intervened, he might have found them.\n\nThe jury convicted Mohamud. A judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe story could have ended there. But, months after the trial, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers received an unexpected message from the government: At some point in the investigation, the FBI had used the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, a law known as the FAA, to access Mohamud\u2019s communications without a particular warrant.\n\nMohamud is the very first defendant to\u200b potentially challenge the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden before the U.S. Supreme Court. ID: 7349035\n\nThe notification was bewildering. The government is supposed to inform defendants they have been targeted by FAA spying before they go to trial, not after. More broadly, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution \u2014 at least as many legal experts understand it \u2014 protects citizens and those living in the U.S. from warrantless surveillance.\n\nToday, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers are asking the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn their client\u2019s conviction. Their central argument is that the FBI\u2019s use of the FAA against Mohamud violated the Constitution.\n\nMohamud is the very first criminal defendant to challenge the FAA before a court of appeals, which opens the door for a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeal has widespread implications: The controversial law provides the legal framework for the mass surveillance programs that Edward Snowden revealed in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration,\u201d Patrick Toomey, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney, told BuzzFeed News, \u201cto say that the privacy rights of millions of Americans potentially hang in the balance of his case.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350052\n\nThe chain of events that led to Mohamud\u2019s appeal began in 1978, when Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, or FISA. In its original version, the law forbade the government from spying within U.S. territory, unless it could convince a special court that the investigation\u2019s targets were \u201cagents of a foreign power.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe law was far from perfect: The special court met in secret and approved nearly all of the government\u2019s requests. (Of the 35,333 applications for FISA warrants filed between 1979 and 2013, only 12 were rejected outright.) Still, the act required the government to name the individuals it was targeting, specify the kind of communications it wanted to intercept, and give a timeline for the investigation \u2014 provisions that generally kept it in line with the Fourth Amendment.\n\nInstead of targeting individuals already engaged in criminal conduct, the FBI after Sept. 11, 2001, began focusing on people who it believed could potentially become terrorists. ID: 7349033\n\nAll of that changed after Sept. 11, 2001. Instead of treating terrorism as a crime to be solved after it happened, the government began to treat it as a disaster to be prevented. In 2002, President Bush signed a secret executive order authorizing the National Security Agency to monitor every email, telephone call, and text message in which at least one party was believed to be outside the U.S. \u2014 even if everyone else in the conversation was located within the country. The administration said the NSA didn\u2019t need any kind of warrant, from the FISA court or otherwise, because such communications counted as \u201cforeign\u201d rather than \u201cdomestic,\u201d and were therefore not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe FBI, however, faced a problem: All that monitoring of communications was turning up a lot of terrorist sympathizers, but not a lot of actual criminal activity. The bureau responded by refining one of its most controversial techniques: the sting operation. Instead of targeting individuals already engaged in criminal conduct, the FBI began focusing on people who it believed could potentially become terrorists.\n\nUnderlying many of these sting operations was a psychological doctrine \u2014 strongly challenged by several studies \u2014 known as \u201cradicalization theory,\u201d which held that individuals with extreme political opinions tended to look for like-minded people and eventually take violent action.\n\nMany American Muslims believe the government uses sting operations to unfairly target their communities and that radicalization theory contributes to Islamophobia. \u201cWhen people assume that one of their community members could be an informant for the government, that creates a ripple effect,\u201d Kayse Jama, a Somali-American organizer who works in Portland, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey can\u2019t trust the people at their mosque. They can\u2019t trust anyone. They feel they can\u2019t speak freely.\u201d Studies suggest that at least some of Jama\u2019s fears are well-founded.\n\nFederal courts convict nearly 90% of those of accused of terrorism, most of them through guilty pleas. This means the facts of most homegrown terrorism cases are rarely entered into the public record, which in turn means the FBI is almost never forced to argue the legality of its techniques. Mohamud\u2019s case is one of few exceptions.\n\nID: 7350061\n\nMohamed Osman Mohamud was born on Aug. 11, 1991, in Mogadishu, Somalia. Months earlier, rebels had ousted the country\u2019s long-standing dictator, unleashing a civil war that rages to this day. On the way to the hospital, Mohamud\u2019s parents had to confront armed thugs. They were lucky to find a doctor who helped with the baby\u2019s breech birth.\n\n\n\nThe family fled to America. Mohamud\u2019s father, Osman Mohamud Barre, went first, quitting his engineering professorship at Somali National University. Mohamud stayed behind, spending a year in a Kenyan refugee camp with his mother, Mariam Hassan.\n\nThe U.S. granted Barre refugee status. He settled in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he worked 13 hours a day at an Intel assembly line. By 1993, he had saved enough money to bring his family to the U.S. \u201cThey were malnourished and suffering, but they were happy,\u201d Barre later testified at his son\u2019s trial. \u201cWe were grateful to America.\u201d\n\nBarre climbed the ranks at Intel. He and Mariam had two more children. They moved to Beaverton, a prosperous suburb in southwest Portland. Mohamud devoured the Harry Potter series and became an NBA fan. He did well in school and made friends easily. \u201cYou would never see him alone,\u201d Joshua Alinger, who befriended Mohamud in elementary school, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nEarly in high school, Mohamud became interested in religion, even as his parents became less observant. Several of his friends said many Muslim families in Beaverton felt that Mohamud exerted a positive influence. \u201cWhenever we tried to do something that went against our religion, like date a girl, [Mohamud] was like a stopping point,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s best friend, who is not identified in the public record and who spoke on condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHe would just give us that look.\u201d\n\nMohamud also joined in the hijinks of American adolescence. By junior year, he began skipping school. His best friend said the two of them would sneak out to a nearby community college to play pool. They made friends with an older student, who bought them alcohol and let them hang at his house. \u201cI think he wanted to be a normal suburban teenager,\u201d said James Duncan, an English teacher at Westville High School who oversaw Mohamud\u2019s study hall.\n\nLike many refugee children, Mohamud had to deal with cultural barriers that separated him from his parents, his American friends, and his mostly white classmates. There is little question he felt different. For an issue of the class magazine, for example, Duncan asked his students to draw cartoons of themselves and caption them. Under his portrait, Mohamud wrote, \u201cI\u2019m the black one.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Mariam and Barre began to go through a breakup, Mohamud\u2019s best friend said. \u201cHome was kind of a hostile environment for him,\u201d the friend said. \u201cHe tried to spend as much time as possible out of the house.\u201d\n\n(Reached at her home in suburban Portland, Mohamud\u2019s mother declined to comment, saying her son\u2019s attorneys had instructed her not to speak to reporters. \u201cBut one day,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be able to speak out about his case, inshallah\u201d \u2014 God willing. Mohamud\u2019s father did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nMariam Barre at her son\u2019s trial. Rick Bowmer / AP Photo ID: 7340349\n\nAs his parents\u2019 relationship deteriorated, Mohamud began spending more and more time at the Masjed As-Saber, a local mosque led by a Somali imam named Mohamed Kariye. The cleric had a complicated history. According to an immigration complaint, he spent part of his youth fighting with the Afghan mujahideen, a jihadi organization that counted Osama bin Laden among its supporters. (At the time, however, the U.S. supported the group in its fight against the Soviet Union.) In 2003, the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism unit arrested him and charged him with Social Security fraud. (The imam pleaded guilty and paid roughly $5,000 in fines.) Today, the government is trying to take away the imam\u2019s American citizenship.\n\nKariye\u2019s teaching \u2014 Wahhabism, a traditionalist Sunni practice \u2014 proved too restrictive for some members of Portland\u2019s Muslim community. The family of Mohamud\u2019s best friend, for example, used to attend Friday prayers at the Masjed As-Saber, but eventually switched to another congregation. Mohamud\u2019s parents, too, were \u201ctotally against the mosque,\u201d his best friend said. For the teenager, frequenting the masjed became a form of rebellion.\n\nAt Kariye\u2019s mosque, Mohamud met Amro al-Ali, an 18-year-old exchange student from Saudi Arabia. According to Marc Sageman, a former CIA officer who testified on \u201copen source information\u201d at Mohamud\u2019s trial, the Saudi was \u201ca wannabe\u201d who liked to talk big about jihad but was, at least at that point, \u201cnot a terrorist.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting al-Ali, Mohamud began frequenting extremist websites, where he answered a call for submissions to an English-language webzine called Jihadi Recollections. The publication was the brainchild of Samir Khan, a Pakistani-American editor based in North Carolina. Khan commissioned him to write an article on fitness training, marking the beginning of a six-month-long collaboration.\n\nBut then, on Aug. 15, 2009, four days after his 18th birthday, Mohamud cut off contact with Khan. He wrote to Khan saying he was \u201cgoing through a lot of things.\u201d\n\n(Shortly after Mohamud\u2019s last email, Khan traveled to Yemen, where he became the editor of Inspire, the English-language outlet of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. government killed him in 2011, in the same drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a top al-Qaeda figure and a U.S. citizen.)\n\nMohamud was indeed going through a lot \u2014 his parents had finally divorced. \u201cYou could see his discontent, sadness, and unhappiness,\u201d the teen\u2019s grandmother told his defense team. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to either one of them because there was no union. He definitely tried to talk them into staying together many, many times.\u201d\n\nIt was in that context that Mohamud received the email that sealed his fate. On Aug. 31, 2009, al-Ali sent him information about a religious school in Yemen. The thought of escaping to a distant land, away from his parents, appears to have seduced the teen. He stormed out of his mother\u2019s house and called his father to say he was moving to the Middle East. Barre tried to convince him to wait, but Mohamud said he already had a ticket and a visa. Barre called Mariam and asked her to look for their son\u2019s passport. It was missing.\n\nBarre panicked. He had heard stories about kids from Minnesota\u2019s Somali-American community who\u2019d been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d into joining the civil war. He remembered one news report of a teen who fled \u2014 the parents later found a photo of him on the internet \u201cshot in the head, dead, in Somalia.\u201d\n\nNot knowing who to call, Barre contacted the FBI. \u201cCan you guys help me to stop my son and make him not leave the country?\u201d he asked the agent who picked up the phone. The agent took down Mohamud\u2019s full name, date of birth, and address and told Barre to meet one of his colleagues at the parking lot of a local high school.\n\nMeanwhile, Mariam found her son. He was in a playground not far from her house. She took his passport and drove him back home.\n\nMohamed Mohamud is seen in this undated handout photo. Obtained by BuzzFeed News ID: 7340312\n\nThat afternoon, Barre met with FBI Special Agent Isaac DeLong, of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \u201cWhy terrorism?\u201d Barre asked. \u201cAre you alluding that we are Muslim and my son\u2019s name is Mohamed? There\u2019s no terrorism here. We\u2019re citizens.\u201d\n\nBarre explained that he wanted to keep his son from returning to Somalia. DeLong replied that there was nothing the bureau could do, because Mohamud was an adult.\n\nThat evening, the father and son had a difficult conversation. \u201cI left my country because of violence,\u201d Barre told Mohamud. \u201cI brought you here to give you a life of prosperity.\u201d Mohamud told his father had nothing to hide: al-Ali, a friend from the mosque, had recommended a school in Yemen. \u201cYou can learn Arabic and Islam once you finish school here and become mature enough to know wrong or right,\u201d Barre replied.\n\nBarre forwarded al-Ali\u2019s email to the FBI, with a note saying he had spoken to Mohamud and the situation was under control. Unbeknownst to him, DeLong ran Mohamud\u2019s email address through what he described at trial as \u201can FBI database.\u201d The search, according to court records, turned out an interesting result: Mohamud had been in touch with the subject of another investigation \u2014 Samir Khan.\n\n\u201cI took this information to my superior,\u201d DeLong testified. \u201cWe decided to open a case.\u201d\n\nID: 7350063\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s warrantless surveillance operations remained secret until December 2005, when the New York Times published an expos\u00e9. The article unleashed outrage that pushed the president to seek retroactive legislative approval for the program. In July 2008, the Senate approved the FISA Amendments Act, or FAA.\n\n\n\nThe new law overwrote many of FISA\u2019s provisions, empowering the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize surveillance of people \u201creasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\u201d Those offices no longer had to get warrants, as the original law mandated. Instead, they simply had to present the FISA court with a set of general procedures meant to \u201cminimize\u201d the \u201cincidental\u201d surveillance of people in the U.S.\n\nOn the same day President Bush signed the FAA, the ACLU filed a suit saying the law violated the First and Fourth Amendments. \u201cThe act does not require the government to demonstrate that its surveillance targets are foreign agents,\u201d the ACLU wrote in its complaint. \u201cThe statute does not require the government to identify its surveillance targets at all.\u201d\n\nThe suit, Amnesty v. Clapper, reached the Supreme Court. In February 2013, however, Justice Samuel Alito delivered an opinion declining to hear the case. He said the only people with standing to challenge the act were criminal defendants who, unlike the ACLU, knew for certain that their communications had been intercepted. (At that time, the government had not informed a single defendant of its use of the FAA.)\n\nThen, in May 2013, Edward Snowden handed a group of journalists a cache of classified documents. The leaks detailed how the NSA invokes the FAA to intercept, store, and in some cases review the telephone and internet communications of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 many of them citizens and residents of the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent domestic law enforcement agencies have access to the immense databases of information obtained through warrantless surveillance. In the past, the government has said FBI agents assigned to criminal investigations cannot see the data.\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350065\n\nEarly in September 2009, Mohamud moved to Corvallis, a small city a few hours south of Portland, to attend classes at Oregon State University. It was too late to enroll officially, so he couldn\u2019t live in the dorms. His parents agreed to give him $300 a month for rent. Mohamud\u2019s best friend, however, had just started at OSU, where he shared a large dorm room with two other students. Since they had an extra bed, they invited Mohamud to live with them for free. In exchange, \u201cwe called his rent budget our booze budget,\u201d the friend said.\n\nFBI documents described Mohamud as a \u201cconfused college kid that talks mildly radical jihad out one ear, and drugs, sex, drinking out the other.\u201d ID: 7349037\n\nThe group soon expanded to include two young men, Raed and Mohamed. Two of Mohamud\u2019s roommates were dating a pair of best friends, and the dorm became the center of a tight-knit social scene. (The other roommates and the women declined requests for comment.) \u201cOur freshman year was a drunken mess,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s best friend said. \u201cIt was a blast.\u201d\n\nMohamud\u2019s friends from that time acknowledged he was easy to influence. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to drink anymore,\u2019 but he could be persuaded to do it,\u201d said Raed. \u201cLike, a friend of mine would be like, \u2018No, come on, let\u2019s just drink for one more week,\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe FBI, which trial testimony shows was already reading Mohamud\u2019s communications and had agents physically following him, agreed with Raed\u2019s assessment. (The bureau refuses to disclose when, exactly, the surveillance began.) In emails sent to other FBI agents in the fall of 2009, Special Agent DeLong wrote that the \u201cmanipulable\u201d and \u201cconflicted\u201d teen appeared to have \u201cleft behind his radical thinking.\u201d Christopher Henderson, the special agent who took over the case when Mohamud moved to Corvallis, described the teen in internal emails as \u201ca confused college kid that talks mildly radical jihad out one ear, and typical 18-year-old college kid (drugs, sex, drinking) out the other.\u201d\n\nMohamed Mohamud is seen in this undated handout photo. Obtained by BuzzFeed News ID: 7340475\n\nThen, on Halloween, Mohamud and his crew headed to a fraternity party. Mohamud \u201cwas drinking like a normal person, dancing with girls,\u201d and brought a woman home, Raed said. At the dorm, Raed said, they began having sex \u201cin front of everybody, on the top bunk.\u201d The friends eventually left the room.\n\nThe following morning, two Oregon State Police officers were in the dorm. The cops said that a young woman had filed a crime report accusing Mohamud of drugging and raping her.\n\nMohamud met with Detective Eli Chambers at the campus police office for a polygraph test. He denied having drugged the woman, but admitted that she was very drunk \u2014 \u201cmore drunk than I thought,\u201d Mohamud said, according to Chambers\u2019 report.\n\nChambers closed his investigation without pressing charges against Mohamud. Still, the incident rattled the student. After the polygraph, he wrote a long post in one of the forums he frequented:\n\nI swear by Allah I have become so lost. And I want so badly to be in a muslim land. I keep telling myself that if I lived in a muslim land I would become so pious. [\u2026] Being in University and living on campus hasn\u2019t helped me too much either. I have fallen into so many things (i.e. alcohol and women). [\u2026] All I need is some soft words to help my heart and supporting advice.\n\nInstead of soft words, Mohamud began receiving emails from Bill Smith, a recent convert to Islam who lived in eastern Idaho and wanted to \u201cget more involved in the fight\u201d against enemies of the Prophet. Smith, however, was a fictional character created by FBI Special Agent Jason Dodd of the Portland field office.\n\n(There were a number of oddities in Dodd\u2019s decision to begin an operation against Mohamud. At trial, the agent testified that Special Agent DeLong authorized the \u201cBill Smith\u201d emails, but DeLong could not recall such thing. Special Agent Elvis Chan, who would eventually run the operation that resulted in Mohamud\u2019s conviction, testified that he did not know about the \u201cBill Smith\u201d emails until after the arrest.)\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2009, just days after a Muslim U.S. Army major killed 13 people at the military base in Fort Hood, Bill Smith t0ld Mohamud that he had seen news reports of \u201cbrothers trying to fight.\u201d \u201cI want to, as well,\u201d Smith wrote in one of about two dozen emails. \u201cWhat can I do? Do you know who I can talk to? Can you help?\u201d Mohamud did not engage him, cautioning him instead to be careful about what he said on the internet.\n\nBut then, on Dec. 3, 2009, someone familiar reached out to Mohamud. \u201cSalamz bro,\u201d the message read. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Amro.\u201d Al-Ali said he was making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia. If Mohamud wanted to join, he said, a \u201cbro\u201d would contact him \u201cabout the proper paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe FBI agents traced al-Ali\u2019s computer not to Mecca, but to the northwestern border of Pakistan, one of the centers of violent jihad. The agents became convinced that al-Ali was writing in code, trying to recruit Mohamud as a fighter. Two months earlier, Interpol had issued an Arabic-language \u201cred notice\u201d \u2014 a sort of international \u201cwanted\u201d poster \u2014 saying al-Ali was \u201cknown to be connected to a fugitive wanted by Saudi Arabian authorities who is an expert in manufacturing explosives and in facilitating the movement of extremists inside Saudi Arabia,\u201d according to a translation included in a defense brief. \u201cHe also helped al-Qaeda division in Yemen and other countries by providing them with foreign fighters to carry out terrorist attacks against western and tourist interests.\u201d\n\n(Later, the defense and the prosecution had heated arguments about the notice, which was ambiguous in Arabic and became vaguer in translation. Was al-Ali a member of al-Qaeda, or merely associated with a member? The matter was further complicated when the Saudis captured al-Ali, holding him without charges and subjecting him to repeated interrogations. A former intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that classified reports detailing those interrogations show that al-Ali didn\u2019t remember Mohamud.)\n\nMohamud responded that joining the pilgrimage would be \u201cwonderful.\u201d Al-Ali sent him a Gmail username and password, with instructions to log in to the account and draft, but not send, a message for a brother called Abdul Hadi. The FBI went on high alert, but Mohamud couldn\u2019t figure out the system. No messages were exchanged.\n\nToward the end of spring semester, one of Mohamud\u2019s roommates invited him to spend the summer working on a fishing boat in Alaska. Mohamud\u2019s parents thought it would help discipline their son. They bought him a plane ticket and, on June 14, 2010, drove him to Portland International Airport.\n\nThe family made it only to the security checkpoint, where an airline employee told Mohamud he couldn\u2019t board. As the family stood at the concourse, a man in a dark suit introduced himself as Special Agent Bradford Petrie. \u201cI understand Mohamed was not allowed to fly today,\u201d Petrie told the family. \u201cWe\u2019d like to talk about that if we could.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350078\n\nA week earlier, the FBI had decided to launch a full-scale undercover operation against Mohamud. Miltiadis Trousas, an agent based in the FBI office in Eugene, Oregon, wrote to Special Agent Chan, a sting specialist based in San Francisco, to suggest targeting the teen \u201cusing everything we have on him,\u201d including the fact that he was \u201cshy around authority figures.\u201d When the agents learned of Mohamud\u2019s plans to travel to Alaska, they worried he might try to continue to Pakistan or Yemen. They placed him on the no-fly list.\n\n\n\nAt the Portland airport, Petrie brought Mohamud and his parents to a conference room. Barre asked whether his call to the FBI a year earlier had anything to do with his son\u2019s placement on the no-fly list. Mohamud denied visiting extremist websites. Petrie concluded the interview promising the family he\u2019d try to \u201chelp\u201d the teenager. He said nothing about the operation.\n\nA few days after the interview at the airport, Chan contacted an FBI agent in California and asked him to fly to Portland to play an \u201cal-Qaeda spotter\u201d in a sting against a suspected teenage radical. The agent, who had been born and raised in an Arabic country, assumed the name Youssef.\n\nYoussef got in touch with Mohamud nine days after the airport incident. The goal was to set up an in-person meeting, purportedly to assess whether the teen was serious about wanting to join a militant organization. The agent wrote in the voice of the \u201cbrother\u201d whom al-Ali had earlier told Mohamud to contact, and whom the teenager never reached out to. \u201cSalamz, bro,\u201d the message began. \u201cGo to hushmail.com and set up an account.\u201d Mohamud replied with an innocuous greeting from an encrypted account. Two days later, Youssef wrote back: \u201cAre you still able to help the brothers?\u201d\n\nMohamud wrote back something noncommittal. Youssef\u2019s next email suggested that God\u2019s plan for Mohamud was in Portland: \u201cAllah I\u2019m sure has good reason for you to stay where you are,\u201d the undercover agent wrote. He said he was traveling to Oregon and asked the teen to meet him in person.\n\nMohamud ignored the message. Worried about losing their target, the agents sent another. A week later, Mohamud responded by inviting Youssef to Friday services at the Masjed As-Saber. The FBI, however, did not want to send an undercover agent to a place of worship. Instead, the agent suggested meeting in downtown Portland. Mohamud grew suspicious. \u201cHow did you get my email?\u201d the teen wrote. \u201cAnd if Amro did give you my email, then how do you know him? And describe him to me if you really do know him.\u201d\n\nThe FBI did not know what al-Ali looked like. To avoid blowing Youssef\u2019s cover, the agents invented a fictional organization, which they called the \u201cIhata,\u201d or Council. They told Mohamud that \u201ca brother from Oregon\u201d told the Council about him, prompting the group to send Youssef to interview him. Flattered, Mohamud agreed to meet on July 30, 2010.\n\nFor the first meeting, Youssef wore a suit to match his cover: a business traveler with connections across many countries. He met Mohamud on a street corner and walked with him to the Embassy Suites, a hotel blocks away from Pioneer Square.\n\nThe public record of that meeting is incomplete. In what the FBI claimed was an honest mistake, Youssef\u2019s tape recorder had dead batteries. Apart from the anonymous agent\u2019s testimony, the only source for what Mohamud said that day is a summarized report prepared by Chan. At trial, Chan said he had destroyed his original notes.\n\n(The defense took great issue with this at trial. Entrapment law requires prosecutors to show that a defendant was predisposed to commit the crime before the first contact with government agents. The nuances of Mohamud\u2019s behavior and language during the first meeting, the defense argued, were vital.)\n\nIn the FBI\u2019s account of the meeting, Youssef and Mohamud sat at a table in a corner of the hotel lobby. The agent said the Council wanted to interview seven possible candidates in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\u201cSo, what have you been doing to be a good Muslim?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\nMohamud said he\u2019d written religious poems and a couple of articles for Jihadi Recollections.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you can\u2019t go overseas,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cSo, what can you do for the cause? What do you want to do for the cause right now?\u201d\n\nInstead of answering with a concrete proposition, Mohamud told him about a dream in which he went to the mountains of Yemen, received training, and led a Muslim army against the infidels in Afghanistan. The undercover agent then repeated his question \u2014 what could the teen do for the cause? Mohamud said he could do \u201canything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave him five examples of how you could be a good Muslim,\u201d Youssef testified at trial. Mohamud, the agent said, could pray five times a day, train as a doctor and go overseas, donate money to the cause, become \u201coperational,\u201d or become \u201ca martyr.\u201d\n\nMohamud replied he wanted to become operational. Youssef asked what he meant. According to the FBI agent, the teen said he wanted to \u201cget a car, fill it with explosives, park it near a target location, and detonate the vehicle.\u201d Youssef told Mohamud he \u201chad a brother that could help him with explosives\u201d and instructed him \u201cto research possible places within the Portland area as possible targets.\u201d The two then parted ways.\n\nThe FBI brought a second undercover agent into the operation: a detective from a suburban police department in California assigned to his city\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force. Like Youssef, the second agent was born and raised in an Arabic-speaking country. For the sake of the operation, he assumed the name Hussein. He prepared to play the role of a mature and deeply religious explosives expert.\n\nTwo weeks later, Mohamud met again with Youssef. The script for that meeting, the agent testified, was to \u201csell\u201d the teen to Hussein, who was supposed to be initially skeptical. Youssef and Mohamud went to a room at the Embassy Suites, where Hussein was waiting \u2014 and where the FBI had installed several hidden cameras. They shared a meal to break the Ramadan fast.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Hussein asked, according to his testimony.\n\nMohamud responded he wanted \u201ca truck or a car and explosives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be glad to sell you a truck!\u201d Hussein said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mohamud answered, \u201cI want it for something else.\u201d\n\nThe teen launched into a rant about the need to punish the U.S. for attacks against Muslims.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s going on right now?\u201d Mohamud said, according to a transcript of the recordings included in the prosecution\u2019s trial memorandum. \u201cThe U.S. is losing the war. So they have resorted to intentionally killing civilians. And, you know, God, the glorified, the exalted, said in the Quran that if they kill your women and children intentionally, then you are allowed to do the same to them.\u201d\n\nThe conversation shifted toward more concrete plans. Had Mohamud found a target in the Portland area, like Youssef requested?\n\n\u201cDo you guys know Pioneer Square?\u201d the teen said. \u201cWhen they have events, everybody comes up there. So, on the 26th of November, they have a Christmas tree lighting and some 25,000 people attend. You know, the streets are packed. I thought, I thought if you could help me, you know, to have, to have a truck. \u2026 You know, explosives, inshallah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is what\u2019s in your heart?\u201d Youssef said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s going to be a lot of children there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\n\u201cFor kids?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\n\u201cNo, just for a huge mass,\u201d Mohamud said. \u201cYou know, for them to be attacked in their own element, with their families, celebrating the holidays.\u201d\n\nHussein asked Mohamud if he wanted to kill himself with the bomb.\n\nThe undercover FBI agent asked Mohamud if he wanted to kill himself with the bomb. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind that,\u201d the teen said. ID: 7349044\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind that,\u201d the teenager said. He began to stutter. \u201cThat, that, that, I mean, if I wasn\u2019t in it, then, you know, then, they\u2019ll look for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are not worried?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\n\u201cIf you were going to paradise, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry, right?\u201d Mohamud answered. \u201cYes, I will push the button.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllah is looking at you right now,\u201d Youssef said.\n\n\u201cYou know what I like, what makes me happy? You know what I like to see? When I see the enemy of Allah, and, you know, their bodies are torn everywhere,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\nAnticipating an entrapment defense and a jury of liberal Portlanders, the undercover agents made sure to give Mohamud a way out. \u201cWe want to make sure that it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s in your heart,\u201d Youssef told the teen. \u201cIf we get all the way there and you\u2019re like, uh-oh \u2014 even if that happens, we\u2019ll be disappointed, but you always have a choice, you understand? With us you always have a choice.\u201d\n\nOn the drive home, Mohamud burst into tears. After he left the car, with the cameras still rolling, Hussein looked at his partner. \u201cIt\u2019s almost too good to be true,\u201d he said.\n\nPioneer Courthouse Square, the site of Mohamud\u2019s attempted bombing, is seen on Nov. 27, 2010, in Portland, Oregon. Craig Mitchelldyer / Getty Images ID: 7340573\n\nOver the next few months, Youssef and Hussein met with Mohamud on five more occasions. They began giving him tasks. First, they sent him shopping for a timer, two cell phones, a toggle switch, and a snap connector. They asked him to find a few possible parking spots near Pioneer Square. Later, they told him to rent a storage shed where they could build the bomb.\n\nMore than anything else, they praised him: \u201cYou got a lot of talent, brother Mohamed.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re probably smarter than most people.\u201d \u201cI think you can be a great poet.\u201d \u201cI trust you with my life.\u201d \u201cWe love you, for the sake of Allah.\u201d\n\nAs the operation progressed, the two agents grew concerned that Mohamud was becoming suicidal, so they decided to tell the teen that the Council would help him flee to a Muslim country after the attack. They were also worried that Mohamud would tell someone, so they gave him $2,700 to rent an off-campus apartment away from his friends. In a moment of telling na\u00efvet\u00e9, the teenager asked the two men he thought were al-Qaeda recruiters to sign as his guarantors for the lease.\n\nThe change in Mohamud\u2019s lifestyle did not go unnoticed by his friends. He wouldn\u2019t show up to class or parties. He stopped going to Friday prayers at the Corvallis mosque. \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t really understand why he was drifting away,\u201d Mohamed, one of the college friends, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cAnd then Raed said, like, \u2018Hey man, we feel like there\u2019s something up. Like, he\u2019s not the same anymore.\u2019\u201d On the few occasions when they saw him, he seemed anxious and in distress.\n\n\u201cOne of my friends and I, we\u2019d be walking to a party,\u201d Raed said. \u201cAnd Mohamed would be extremely drunk, and he would go to one of my friends and say, \u2018Are you the FBI? Are you the FBI?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe night before the bombing, Mohamud had Thanksgiving dinner in Beaverton with a few friends. Afterward, they went shopping at a nearby mall. Several people who were there told BuzzFeed News that Mohamud seemed to be having a really good time. He insisted on buying coffee for everyone. He poured marshmallow liquor into his cup. He made jokes and laughed and acted like his old self, the way he used to be freshman year, before he moved out of the dorms and began spending all of his time alone.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019m having the greatest morning of my life,\u2019\u201d Raed, who ran into Mohamud at 4 a.m. outside a J.C. Penney, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nLater that day, Mohamud called his best friend to ask about his plans. The friend said he was going to see the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Mohamud told him to stay home, but didn\u2019t explain. The two have not spoken since.\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7349079\n\nShortly after his arrest, Mohamud was appointed three lawyers from the Portland Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office: Steve Sady, Steve Wax, and Lisa Hay. According to attorneys from around the country, the three were among the best terrorism lawyers in the U.S. All three declined to comment.\n\n\n\nMohamud\u2019s trial began on Jan. 10, 2013, more than two years after the arrest. In her opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Pamala Holsinger called Mohamud a \u201cprolific user\u201d of extremist websites, saying he was \u201cwell known\u201d for his work for Samir Khan.\n\nHolsinger said the government had contacted Mohamud because a \u201cknown terrorist\u201d was trying to recruit him. She said the government would prove Mohamud\u2019s attempt to travel to Alaska was a step toward his ultimate destination: Yemen. The prosecutor concluded by emphasizing the best evidence against Mohamud: \u201cThe defendant dialed this phone. And when the phone didn\u2019t go off, he dialed it again.\u201d\n\nSady, in his opening statement, accused the FBI of using \u201cflattery\u201d to get a manipulable teenager to do their bidding, invoking God and appealing to his fragile ego to make him do \u201cthe little things and big things that ended up bringing evidence into court today.\u201d The federal defender told the jury he understood the difficulty of putting aside emotion to acquit a person who thought he was carrying out a heinous act. He implored jurors to evaluate the case based on law rather than hypothetical destruction.\n\n\u201cWe all want law enforcement to stop crime\u200b,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s defense lawyer said.\u200b \u200b\u201cBut the FBI cannot create the very crime they intend to stop.\u201d ID: 7349050\n\n\u201cIn America, we don\u2019t create crime. The entrapment defense is how this fundamental American value is made real in the courts,\u201d Sady said. \u201cIt\u2019s a line the government cannot cross. We all want law enforcement to stop crime. But the FBI cannot create the very crime they intend to stop.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s case was a rare look into an FBI undercover investigation \u2014 warts and all. Over nine days, 14 agents took the stand. Several were forced to confront off-color comments caught on tape during surveillance. During his cross-examination, Special Agent Mario Galindo \u2014 who had just explained to the jury that the reason the first face-to-face meeting was not recorded was because he accidentally left the recorder powered on the night before the operation \u2014 was asked to confirm a sexually suggestive comment he made after Mohamud first met the bomb expert, Hussein.\n\nSady: Did you express a feeling of enthusiasm by using a metaphor for sexual excitement? Galindo: Which one? Sady: Did you say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people with woodies up here right now?\u201d Galindo: Yes, I said that.\n\nBoth undercover agents testified for days. At one point, Lisa Hay grilled Youssef:\n\nHay: Did Mohamud say what kind of truck? Youssef: He did not. Hay: So the FBI decided what kind of truck, didn\u2019t they? Youssef: Yes. Hay: The FBI decided the size of the bomb? Youssef: Yes. Hay: The FBI designed the bomb? Youssef: Yes.\n\nMohamud didn\u2019t testify in his own defense, though both his parents did. Barre told the court that he wished he had read his son\u2019s text messages to see what was going on with him. Then, during cross-examination by prosecutor Ethan Knight, the distraught father attacked the actions of the FBI:\n\nKnight: You were concerned, and that\u2019s why you went to the FBI? Barre: I went to the FBI to get help to stop him not to leave the country. Knight: Because you were concerned that he might be brainwashed, isn\u2019t that right? Barre: That is what I was afraid of. But can I tell you, the FBI brainwashed my son.\n\nSeveral of Mohamud\u2019s friends took the stand on his behalf, calling him \u201cgoofy\u201d and \u201cfun-loving.\u201d Raed, however, was subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution. He wasn\u2019t happy about it and found a small way to rebel.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution, they were like, \u2018Make sure you look at the jury and you talk to them eye to eye,\u2019\u201d Raed told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut I\u2019m like, no. If I were here on the defense side, sure, I can be talking straight to the jury. But I\u2019m here because I\u2019m forced to. So I\u2019m going to answer your questions and go on with my day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did look at Mohamed,\u201d Raed went on. \u201cWe did make eye contact. He was crying.\u201d\n\nThe trial closed after 14 days. Knight gave the government\u2019s summation. He reminded the jury that Mohamud had believed the bomb was real. The case, Knight argued, was about \u201ca choice, a single and remarkable choice by this defendant to take the lives of thousands of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn individual simply cannot be entrapped to commit an offense such as this,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThis is the type of offense that one commits only because one wholeheartedly wants to.\u201d\n\nSteven T. Wax, left, and Stephen R. Sady, right. Rick Bowmer / AP Photo ID: 7340513\n\nSady, the defense lawyer, gave an impassioned closing argument, citing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet novelist who was forced into exile after publishing The Gulag Archipelago. \u201cSolzhenitsyn says, \u2018There is a line between good and evil that runs through the hearts of all people,\u2019\u201d Sady said. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be pushing that line.\u201d\n\nAfter seven hours of deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict.\n\nNine months later, Mohamud was sentenced. The government asked that Mohamud be given 40 years in prison, while his defense team pleaded for 10 years. Judge Garr King sentenced Mohamud to 30, citing a case of \u201cimperfect entrapment\u201d carried out by the government.\n\n\u201cNow, the jury found that defendant was not entrapped, but imperfect entrapment is available as a defense,\u201d King said from the bench. \u201cAnd in this case, it weighs slightly in favor of defendant in this case. The court realizes the agents often reminded the defendant he could back out of the plan if he had a change of heart, but that is balanced by the government\u2019s inducement through the agent\u2019s use of praise and religious references.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7349085\n\nJust over a month after Mohamud\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court published its decision not to hear the ACLU lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act, or FAA. As a criminal defendant who had been charged using evidence obtained through warrantless surveillance, Mohamud was one of the people who the court believed had standing to sue in place of the ACLU. The government, however, did not notify him of the surveillance until nearly a year after his conviction.\n\nSady and his team furiously litigated the issue. They filed a motion asking the court to force the government to disclose what it had learned about Mohamud using FAA warrantless surveillance. Although the attorneys were careful not to single out particular pieces of evidence for scrutiny, their motion hinted at many possible questions. Did the FBI database that Special Agent DeLong searched when he found out that Mohamud corresponded with Khan include electronic data swept up by FAA laws? What about other types of FAA surveillance that had become publicly known since the Snowden disclosures? Were those surveillance methods used against Mohamud? Could Mohamud be sure he hadn\u2019t been targeted in a myriad of ways, some of them potentially unconstitutional?\n\nFor Mohamud, those questions meant the difference between prison and a new trial. Under a legal doctrine known as \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d courts must suppress any evidence that has roots in illegal government conduct, even if a warrant is later issued to legally obtain the same evidence. If it turns out that unconstitutional surveillance first led the FBI to Mohamud, the prosecution\u2019s entire case could collapse.\n\nJudge King, however, denied Mohamud\u2019s request for more information about the FBI\u2019s tactics, saying he would review the legality of the surveillance in private meetings with prosecutors.\n\nMohamud\u2019s attorneys resorted to broader legal arguments. Much like the ACLU, they claimed the FAA provided \u201cnone of the protections that the First and Fourth Amendments require to limit governmental intrusions on privacy.\u201d A vein of frustration ran through the pleadings, with the defense acknowledging at one point that it sought \u201csuppression of unknown evidence [\u2026] gathered at unknown times by unknown means by unknown persons and agencies operating under unknown protocols.\u201d\n\nThe government responded that the warrantless surveillance in the case did not originally target Mohamud, but rather unspecified foreigners living abroad \u201cwho generally are not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d The fact that communications belonging to American citizens living within the borders of their own country \u2014 such as Khan and Mohamud \u2014 might have been \u201cincidentally\u201d acquired under the authority of the FAA did not \u201crender the collection unreasonable.\u201d\n\nAgain, Judge King sided with the prosecution, denying Mohamud\u2019s request for a new trial. (King declined a request for an interview.)\n\nOn Sep. 4, 2015, Mohamud\u2019s attorneys filed a brief asking the 9th Circuit of the Court of Appeals to overturn King\u2019s decision. The government has until December to file its response. Oral arguments could happen as soon as January 2016. Regardless of the outcome, the losing party is likely to appeal the matter before the Supreme Court.\n\nA victory for the defense could end a significant chapter in the history of American law enforcement. It would follow other incremental decisions \u2014 including June\u2019s passing of the USA Freedom Act, which curbed an NSA program that collected most Americans\u2019 phone records \u2014 that have begun to roll back the emergency policies enacted in the tense days after Sept. 11. Crucially, it wouldn\u2019t just end particular programs, but establish a principle that will guide how courts must balance individual rights against collective security.\n\nBy contrast, a victory for the prosecution would not just keep Mohamud in prison, but also continue the preventive approach to law enforcement that has developed since Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cThe history of the criminal justice system demonstrates that infringements on rights begin in cases against a particular targeted group that does not have any public support,\u201d Joshua Dratel, a defense attorney who has represented many American Muslims accused of terrorism, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHowever, over time those methods that get approved in those cases contaminate ordinary cases against ordinary persons, and especially against those who have politically unpopular opinions.\u201d\n\nID: 7349087\n\nOn a recent autumn evening, Raed and Mohamed met at a bar in Corvallis to share memories about their friend, the convicted terrorist. The two hadn\u2019t talked about Mohamud for a while, in part because things had been rough around campus after he got arrested.\n\n\u201cI mean, my name is Mohamed,\u201d Mohamed told BuzzFeed News. \u201cA lot of racist things have happened to me, many times, even before the incident. Afterwards, when I was on campus and people knew I knew Mohamed or hung out with him, they\u2019d say things like, \u2018Oh, Mo, you fucking terrorist!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, you know,\u201d Raed said, as he flipped through Facebook photos showing himself and his friends at an anti-jihad rally. \u201cFor us to have to show up and be like, \u2018No, this isn\u2019t really us.\u2019\u201d\n\nWould they want to see him again? The friends said nothing for a long time. Eventually, Mohamed broke the silence.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I\u2019d want to see him again would be to sit down with him, just like this,\u201d he said, making a sweeping gesture over the table. \u201cBecause I\u2019m curious. I want to figure out why. I want to say to him, \u2018Some of your friends were [at Pioneer Square]. Why did you want to do it to them?\u2019 Not \u2018Why did you want to do it to everybody?\u2019 Because he, at that time, obviously did not care about everybody. But he had such a close relationship with so many people who were there or could have been there. Why would he specifically want to do that to them?\u201d\n\nRaed then mentioned that Mohamud had written him a few times from prison. \u201cThey\u2019re, like, normal conversations,\u201d he said of the letters. \u201cLike we\u2019re talking like friends. He\u2019s asking how am I doing, how\u2019s my family doing, how\u2019re our friends doing.\u201d\n\nRaed never wrote back."}

We still don't know how many Ford will build (the rules say at least 100 road cars). But we do know what it's like to drive, thanks to Forza Motorsport 6. It's the new Ford GT. Jonathan Gitlin The real purpose of the Ford GT is to give Ferrari, Corvette, Aston Martin, BMW, and Porsche a good kicking in both the Weathertech Sportscar Championship here in the US, and the World Endurance Championship at Le Mans and around the globe. The other teams we've spoken to are having sleepless nights because of this race car. Jonathan Gitlin One of the stars of the LA Auto Show for us was the Alfa Romeo Giulia Quadrifoglio. A four-leaf clover badge on an Alfa usually means its pretty special, and that's the case here. Rear-wheel drive. A six-speed manual gearbox. 505hp (377kW)! This one will set you back ~$70,000, but the base Giulia starts at $40,000. Jonathan Gitlin Alfa also brought the gorgeous Giulia TZ2 along for another outing. Jonathan Gitlin Acura's hybrid NSX has been a little delayed recently, with a late decision to reorient the mid-engined layout from transverse to longitudinal. We still can't wait to drive it, though. Jonathan Gitlin Fiat's biggest news was the new 124 Spider. If you think it looks a bit familiar you'd be right; it's a Mazda MX-5 Miata under the skin. It's had an Italian heart transplant\u2014the engine is a 1.4L turbocharged Fiat MultiAir engine. Jonathan Gitlin BMW's M4 GTS is incredibly mean-looking, with lashings of carbon fiber and a rollcage (in orange, obviously). About 300 are coming to the US, and they'll cost you $134,200. Jonathan Gitlin We're not entirely sold on the M4 GTS's wheels. Jonathan Gitlin The $119,000 Dodge Viper ACR is probably the performance bargain of the century. The previous one set a 7:12 laptime at the N\u00fcburgring in 2010, and this version is expected to beat that in 2016, humbling many more expensive supercars. Jonathan Gitlin We were huge fans of the previous Audi R8 V10 Plus, but the car was showing its age. The mk 2 R8 brings the platform up to date with a Virtual Cockpit and all the bells and whistles. Jonathan Gitlin Lamborghini wasn't at the actual show but did have a new car to reveal in LA. Jonathan Gitlin When we drove the Hurac\u00e1n LP610-4, we felt, if anything, it was a little too easy to drive, too civilized. This is the LP580-2, which we think solves that problem by sending all its power to the rear wheels. The lack of a front diff doesn't appear to have made the frunk any larger. Jonathan Gitlin Subaru really needs to stop teasing us and just build a production version of this BRZ STI Concept. C'mon, you can do it. Jonathan Gitlin Maybe the most desirable Subaru ever? The 22B. Jonathan Gitlin Although one of Colin McRae's old rally cars might just edge it out. Jonathan Gitlin This year's Le Mans winner, the Porsche 919 Hybrid. Porsche also won the WEC manufacturer's championship, and the #17 car of Brendan Hartley, Mark Webber, and Timo Bernhard just managed to grab the driver's championship at the final round of the series this past weekend. Jonathan Gitlin To the right of the 919 Hybrid is Porsche's new Cayman GT4 Clubsport, a turnkey race car for series like IMSA's Continental Tire Sportscar Challenge. Two cars are going to CJ Wilson Racing, about whom you'll be able to read more in the next week or two.\n\nLOS ANGELES\u2014We've already taken a look at the interesting technology on display at this year's LA Auto Show, as well as the cool concepts and custom cars. Today it's the turn of the sportiest stuff. Many of the big names we saw in New York\u2014Aston Martin, Ferrari, McLaren\u2014were absent. A few reappeared, inching closer to production like the Ford GT and Acura NSX. The former is Ford's celebration of its first win at Le Mans in 1966. The latter a hybrid sportscar that's more focused than BMW's i8 but a lot more affordable than any hybrid sports car McLaren, Ferrari, or Porsche has made.\n\nThink of Alfa Romeo's Giulia Quadrifoglio as an Italian take on the M3\u2014rear wheel drive, 505hp, and that endangered species, the manual gearbox. The fire-breathing one with the four-leaf clover will cost around $70,000, but the Giulia range starts at $40,000. We're still a little unsure how we feel about Fiat's Italian take on the Mazda MX-5. From some angles the new nose looks great, and the 1.4L MultiAir engine is interesting.\n\nBMW's new M4 GTS should be extremely potent on track, and the interior detailing goes a long way to making sense of the car's potent price tag. Those looking for lap times beyond all should rather consider the Dodge Viper ACR. For some time now, Dodge's bewinged snake has been soundly trouncing all comers in fast lap competitions, and the latest version should be no exception.\n\nLamborghini isn't exhibiting but unveiled a Hur\u00e1can variant\u2014the LP580-2\u2014the night before the Auto Show opened to journalists. Unlike the LP610-4, it sends all its power to the rear wheels alone, which should address our minor complaint about the all-wheel drive Hur\u00e1can being too civilized to drive.\n\nIts close relative, the new Audi R8, can be found on Audi's stand. This features a Virtual Cockpit like the new TT, as well as a lot of other bells and whistles that hadn't been invented in time for the first R8. If you're local, you can see it, and everything else on display, until November 29 at the LA Convention Center. Assuming you survive the traffic...\n\nListing image by Jonathan Gitlin"}

{"10": "A group associated with the Anonymous hacktivist movement launched what they claimed was a \"total war\" against the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or Daesh), encouraging people to join in an effort allegedly targeting social media accounts associated with the terror organization in response to the attacks in Paris a week ago.

But there has also been a rash of accusations between those associated with different operations, and it's not clear that any of them are achieving anything other than drawing attention to Anonymous again.\n\nSeriously, after #OpISIS there have been too many fame whores.

There's really no escaping it: You call a game \"Halo,\" and you pretty much have to put players in the first-person perspective of armor-clad future-soldiers who battle in both lengthy, plot-driven missions and vehicle-fueled online battles against friends. Both halves of the latest sequel's gameplay will feel instantly familiar to anybody who has used two joysticks to run and gun as a UNSC soldier in the past 14 years.\n\nThis week's Halo 5 is a lot different than the other Halo games, however. Master Chief and friends have been given more new maneuvers here than in any other official sequel. The campaign mode has been built to support four players fighting cooperatively by default (in ways that feel even more extreme than when Halo Reach tried the same trick). Both single-player and multiplayer modes enjoy some serious boosts thanks to being the first Halo game on Xbox One, and the content you'll find in online versus modes has been split up into two distinct halves. One of those has been buffered by a weird card-collecting system to boot.\n\nAfter beating the campaign and spending four days in the game's multiplayer preview period, we've come away ultimately liking the steps Halo 5 has taken to be the ultimate sequel for every fan\u2014it's just new enough, just familiar enough.

Jungle battle. Some very cool designs for the ancient buildings that you very nearly blow up mid-combat. Bluuuuuue. Say hello to the Warden, your new villain. The Warden's top soldiers are some tough humanoid Forerunners. This isn't going well. What's good, Locke? Chief. Chief... Chief! Locke's squad.\n\nWhile we'd always enjoyed the bits of humanity, bravado, and heart tucked into the firefights of past Halo games, we were taken aback by just how well Halo 4's campaign pumped genuine emotion into the franchise. That explosive 2012 quest hinged on the peculiar relationship between a stoic, silent Master Chief and a deteriorating, suffering Cortana. Those extreme opposite personalities bounced off each other nicely.\n\nThis time around, the plot is a little more crowded by default. Halo 5 stars four distinct heroes at all times. A third of the game puts players in control of Chief's fighting foursome, but the majority features a squad led by a similarly terse Spartan named Jameson Locke, tasked with a mission of tracking down and arresting Chief since he's gone off the grid. If you play by yourself, you'll control either Chief or Locke and have three AI-controlled squadmates at all times. Party up with three other friends via Xbox Live, and they'll control the squad's other soldiers.\n\nWhere Halo 4 shined by paring down and narrowing its plot focus on the Chief-Cortana relationship, Halo 5 suffers from a bewildering amount of sprawl and confusion. It's not just that the plot jumps around in time and location by following both Chief and Locke's separate, barely entwined quests. The already-strained feeling of continuity and cohesion suffers further with subplots that land abruptly and without warning like the series' orbital insertion pods. Why are we arrest-rescuing Dr. Halsey? Why should we care about the angry denizens of a military outpost when they whine at us with barely any backstory? How did we wind up in the middle of an out-of-nowhere civil war between Covenant creatures?\n\nWe also walked away from Halo 5 remembering nothing personality-wise about any of the eight lead characters. Well, Buck is an exception\u2014though only because his voice actor, Firefly and Castle star Nathan Fillion, instilled humor and life into his ho-hum script by brute acting force. Even in his case, we're told nothing about how he rose from trooper (in Halo 3: ODST) to full-on Spartan, let alone any other decent backstory context for anybody else.\n\nA new villain known as the Warden picks up a ton of slack with a monstrous vocal performance, full of the kind of brutal teasing and emotional manipulation you want in a grandiose action film's lead baddy. Cortana's return, however, is dogged by a total lack of believability. Saying more would spoil her plot line, but in short, her sloppily written lines won't fool anybody. Most of the game's voice acting comes from Locke, and the blame for his forgettable turn as a lead hero must be split equally between too-rigid dialogue and stilted acting.\n\nThe game's eagerness to squish a zillion plots together, all while failing to write a single decent lead character, isn't the kind of thing players can just \"press A to skip.\" The game contains too many long, controllable and unskippable stretches in which players do nothing but wander around without threat and hear confusing plot. In particular, the game contains three whole missions whose sole goals are to run around semi-open towns, navigate to waypoints, and talk to a few people\u2014yet even these momentum-crushing scenes fail to clarify the confusion.\n\nWe also really disliked the game's placement of countless \"terminals\" at the edges of the campaign's maps; they were a pain to find and offered little payoff for the effort. These terminals are full of brief, unclear, and often flavorless dialogue that hinted to some other backstory\u2014which, like a lot of the rest of the game, seemed to demand that players be familiar with the series' wealth of miniseries, books, and other stories. We mostly felt teased and prodded by this plot-drip device, as if it was constantly berating us for not being big enough Halo fans."}

{"21": "At the start of the month we wrote about Benson Leung, a tenacious Google engineer who had made it his life mission to test various USB Type-C cables and adapters, to check whether they actually conform to USB Type-C specifications. Unsurprisingly, he found that most cheap Type-C cables and adapters do not conform, and could thus could potentially cause damage to your devices while charging.\n\nA week later, the same Google engineer announced an altogether more shocking finding: the USB Type-C cables and adapters sold by smartphone maker OnePlus aren't up to snuff. Here was an official, first-party hardware company selling USB cables and adapters that might damage your devices. As you might expect, the Android community was equal parts apoplectic and perplexed by this development.\n\nFurther Reading USB Type-C. Power Delivery. USB 3.0. Which ports are capable of what features? The USB-IF is trying its best to make sure you're not confused about USB Type-C.\n\nThe issue with the OnePlus USB Type-C cable and adapter was similar to some of the dodgy parts that Leung had previously tested: where OnePlus should've used a 56k\u03a9 resistor, it instead used a 10k\u03a9 resistor. As a result, a connected device may attempt to draw 3A, when the power source (the USB port on your computer, a third-party wall charger) is only rated to supply 2A, potentially frying your power source.\n\nFor example, Google's new Chromebook Pixel, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P will all attempt to draw 3A when possible, to speed up charging. This is why Leung was testing all of these Type-C cables and adapters in the first place.\n\nYesterday, co-founder Carl Pei took to the OnePlus forums to explain the situation, though he stopped short of actually apologising. In summary, Pei said that the company's cables and adapters are safe to use with the OnePlus 2\u2014their only device with a Type-C connector\u2014but that you should be careful when using them with other devices and power sources. He also provided the following table, which is quite useful:\n\nFurther Reading OnePlus X review: Pretty good for \u00a3200, assuming you can actually buy one A lame invite system puts a damper on a low price and great build quality.\n\nIf you bought a Type-C cable or adapter from OnePlus, Pei said that you are eligible for a refund until the end of 2015. If you bought the OnePlus 2, however, the Type-C cable and adapter that came in the box are not eligible for refund \"since they are safe to use with the OnePlus 2.\"\n\nPei also said they're working on \"improved Type-C cables and adapters with 56k\u03a9 resistors,\" though he didn't provide a timeline for their release.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're using a OnePlus USB Type-C cable or adapter\u2014or indeed any of the other non-compliant Type-C parts identified by Leung\u2014make sure you only use it with a solid, first-party power source. Or, indeed, just go out and buy a fully specs-compliant Type-C cable."}
{"22": "On the surface, Amazon appears inefficient. In roughly two decades, the Seattle-based retailer has grown from an ambitious bookseller to a many-headed hydra with its necks extending in seemingly disparate directions. It has an Emmy-winning TV production company, a streaming-video device manufacturer, a distributor of hundreds of \"actually free\" apps, a grocery and restaurant delivery service, a titan in international server storage, an e-book device pioneer, a mobile phone dabbler, an affordable source of two-hour household product deliveries, and on and on the list goes.\n\nAs counterintuitive as it may seem, however, the consistent thread between all of these is efficiency. As Amazon's veritable plate of services spaghetti has grown, they've shared a unifying factor of commerce\u2014of making products available to a ton of people as quickly, consistently, and efficiently as possible. The goal is to keep shoppers coming back, and that doesn't happen without supreme efficiency in every step of the Amazon process.\n\nHorror stories appear on occasion from server outages to products missing their shipping deadlines. But considering the scale at which the company has grown both its internal offerings and its publicly available Amazon Web Services (AWS) products, its ongoing efficiency track record is, by and large, impressive. In particular, Amazon's servers have withstood the brunt of seemingly every Black Friday in the past decade\u2014and its cloud computing services have grown to prop up a significant amount of the Internet with very few noticeable, wide-reaching crashes. (Searching our archives for reports on them only brought up a few.)\n\nThe best way to predict where Amazon will go from here\u2014from announced initiatives to higher-tech offerings we've yet to hear about\u2014is to understand the efficiency that has driven the company's exponential growth. From robots to drones, from warehouse redesigns to database and application debugging tools, the company has come up with many ways to build the leanest paths from a desired product to a delivered one.\n\nNo more Segways\n\nWhen the words \"Amazon\" and \"robots\" have come up in the same sentence recently, they've usually referred to devices like drone-styled aircraft\u2014particularly the ones founder Jeff Bezos announced with a big, 60 Minutes-fueled splash last year. But long before Amazon's Prime Air initiative received its big public reveal, the company was well invested into a separate robotics initiative.\n\nAmazon's 2012 acquisition of Kiva Robotics\u2014which is headquartered in North Reading, Massachusetts, and has since been renamed Amazon Robotics\u2014has figured prominently into how the company runs its \"fulfillment centers,\" where product orders come in and inventory is shipped out. Last year saw the public unveil of what Amazon calls its eighth generation of fulfillment center, meaning the building was designed with much of its workflow revolving around these robots.\n\nA traditional retail-warehouse workflow might require an employee to walk from department to department (or, in higher-tech times, ride on devices like Segways) to find disparate items in a customer's order and toss them into a box, which is then processed by the packing and shipping department. Amazon Robotics turns that workflow around by asking a crew of hundreds of short, Roomba-looking robots to bring all of the products to warehouse employees.\n\nAt Amazon's fulfillment centers, the robots automatically roll around a warehouse that's dotted with stacks of products, and the bots are given assignments to drive under those stacks, pick them up, and carry them around the warehouse. Maybe the robots drop stuff off for warehouse packers or maybe they take an empty stack to a restocking bay. But instead of forcing employees to hunt-and-peck for individual orders, the bots ensure employees receive an efficient queue of stacks to pick through by hand. Employees all along the warehouse chain use smartphone-like devices to scan and keep track of the orders they're working on as well.\n\nAmazon representatives told Ars that they have reduced packing times on individual packages from over an hour to \"as little as minutes\" through this process. And more importantly to Amazon, those giant, moveable stacks of goods\u2014which don't require comfortable, human-sized aisles\u2014allow Amazon to squeeze a lot more merchandise into each fulfillment center. The company estimates a whopping 50 percent increase in inventory per square foot in its eighth generation center over the previous one.\n\nAmazon says it's operating 13 centers in the United States as of today. Combined, they contain \"over 30 thousand robots.\" Company reps insisted that these robots are \"a brand-new kind of robot that's never been used outside of Amazon,\" but while they enjoy ties to Amazon's software and internal package-tracking systems, reps didn't elaborate on how the robots differed hardware-wise from Kiva robots that had been deployed at companies such as Staples and Gap before Amazon acquired the company.\n\nAmazon reps also didn't clarify what we should expect in the upcoming ninth-generation fulfillment center, which is stationed in Kent, Washington, a stone's throw from the company's Seattle headquarters. It stands fair to reason that there'll be a new fleet of robots and further inventory boosts. Video footage of the eighth-gen center proves that processes such as packing, shipping, and picking through individual stacks of products are currently jobs for humans, so it remains to be seen whether any of those will eventually be automated as well. Amazon plans to open its ninth-gen center for fulfillment business sometime next year.\n\nAs for the drone-powered Amazon Prime Air, company reps would only go so far as to say they're \"excited about the project\" and direct us to its public-facing homepage. There, users will find job postings and the company's July 2014 drone-related petition to the FAA, but the site contains nothing about the fact that the FAA issued an experimental airworthiness certificate this past March. Perhaps one day Amazon will be given wider approval to send hundreds of packages via flying drones across major metropolitan areas\u2014where their ability to bypass traffic-clogged streets would certainly increase shipping times\u2014but we're still not sure whether a downtown sky full of flying packages of Tide detergent would be a good advertisement for Amazon or a bad one."}

Xbox One sales seem to be improving and were buoyed last month by the release of Halo 5, but the PS4 continues to widen its lead over Microsoft's console. With Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and then the Christmas shopping periods approaching, Microsoft will no doubt be hoping to close that gap\u2014but with both consoles at around the same price point (\u00a3250/$300/\u20ac300), and some strong games on both sides of the fence, we can't imagine that holiday season sales will differ much from the norm.\n\nEven factoring in the Xbox One's improved sales in October, our analysis shows that the Xbox One wouldn't outsell the PS4 on an annual basis before 2024\u2014and even then, there'd still be a total sales gap of around 50 million consoles. If Microsoft can't do something to narrow the ever-widening chasm, and assuming Sony doesn't do something completely crazy, there could be some difficult decisions to make: for Microsoft, for developers, and ultimately for consumers."}
{"24": "Further Reading Racing goes electric: At the track with Formula E, the first e-racing series Ars checks out the new all-electric racing car series on its first visit to the US.\n\nAutonomous cars are not entirely strangers to the race track. Earlier this year we brought you news of Robby, the autonomous Audi RS7 that has learned the racing line at Sonoma Raceway in California. Robby is apparently as fast as an experienced human racing driver when it comes to lap times, but there's more to racing than just being fast\u2014you need competition. Next year we'll finally get to see what happens when you put 20 autonomous cars on track and race them, thanks to the newly announced support series for Formula E.\n\nCalled Roborace, the new series is a partnership between Formula E and Kinetik, an investment fund that's been putting a lot of money into electric vehicle development. It will follow the Formula E schedule in 2016-2017 with hour-long races between 10 teams, each of which has two cars. The cars will be mechanically identical; the competition will be in coding the AI. According to the release from Formula E, one of the teams will be organized as a crowd-sourced community team, something we plan to look into with greater detail as it develops.\n\nKinetik founder Denis Sverdlov said that Roborace \"is a celebration of revolutionary technology and innovation that humanity has achieved in that area so far. It\u2019s a global platform to show that robotic technologies and AI can co-exist with us in real life. Thus, anyone who is at the edge of this transformation now has a platform to show the advantages of their driverless solutions and this shall push the development of the technology.\u201d\n\nIt's an interesting move, and Formula E is certainly the right partner for Roborace, but even that series has still to win over some motorsport diehards. Will people still find racing interesting if there aren't humans in the cars? It may dissuade those who only show up to watch the crashes, but perhaps their places can be taken by AI enthusiasts and futurologists. I mean, what's more futuristic than robots racing each other?"}
{"25": "Underscoring just how hard it is to design secure cryptographic software, academic researchers recently uncovered a potentially serious weakness in an early version of the code library protecting Amazon Web Services.\n\nIronically, s2n, as Amazon's transport layer security implementation is called, was intended to be a simpler, more secure way to encrypt and authenticate Web sessions. Where the OpenSSL library requires more than 70,000 lines of code to execute the highly complex TLS standard, s2n\u2014short for signal to noise\u2014has just 6,000 lines. Amazon hailed the brevity as a key security feature when unveiling s2n in June. What's more, Amazon said the new code had already passed three external security evaluations and penetration tests.\n\nFurther Reading Two new attacks on SSL decrypt authentication cookies Aging standard isn't holding up very well in face of sophisticated attacks. Amazon's June 30 announcement was only a few hours old when Royal Holloway, University of London Professor Kenny Paterson and his colleagues met for lunch at a nearby pub to discuss the security of s2n. Five days later, they presented Amazon engineers with a report showing that the newly unveiled s2n was vulnerable to \"Lucky 13,\" a TLS attack unveiled in 2013 that made it possible to recover encrypted browser cookies used to access restricted parts of a website. Amazon engineers promptly fixed the errors. In a blog post, Amazon officials said the the vulnerable version of s2n was never used in production and that the proof-of-concept attacks \"did not impact Amazon, AWS, or our customers, and are not the kind that could be exploited in the real world.\"\n\nBy Paterson's estimates, attackers would need to observe about 223, or about 8.39 million, encrypted sessions to recover one byte of plaintext. To a layperson, that may sound like an insurmountable challenge. To cryptographers safeguarding the Web, it was an unacceptable risk. Ironically, in addition to the compact size of s2n and the completion of three external reviews, engineers also put in custom-designed safeguards to harden the TLS implementation against Lucky 13 exploits.\n\n\"Our work highlights the challenges of protecting implementations against sophisticated timing attacks,\" Paterson and colleague Martin Albrecht wrote in a research paper published Monday. \"It also illustrates that standard code audits are insufficient to uncover all cryptographic attack vectors.\"\n\nLucky 13 exploits a subtle timing bug in a TLS mode known as cipher block chaining. Paterson and other researchers behind the Lucky 13 attack discovered CBC-based streams could be manipulated in a way that reveals a limited amount of the plaintext in an encrypted data stream. The plaintext leaked through the timing of error messages that were produced when the modified ciphertexts were processed at a server. The exploit required attackers to receive thousands of different encryptions of the same message. With careful statistical processing, noise in the different timing samples could be eliminated, revealing the target plaintext bytes.\n\nIn Monday's paper, Paterson and Albrecht wrote:\n\nWe show that s2n\u2014as initially released\u2014was vulnerable to a timing attack on its implementation of CBC-mode ciphersuites. Specifically, we show that the two levels of protection offered against the Lucky 13 attack in s2n at the time of first release were imperfect, and that a novel variant of the Lucky 13 attack could be mounted against s2n. The attack is particularly powerful in the web setting, where an attack involving malicious client-side Javascript (as per BEAST, POODLE and Lucky 13) results in the complete recovery of HTTP session cookies, and user credentials such as BasicAuth passwords. In this setting, an adversary runs malicious JavaScript in a victim\u2019s browser and additionally performs a Person-in-the-Middle attack. We note, though, that many modern browsers prefer TLS 1.2 AEAD cipher suites avoiding CBC-mode, making them immune to the attack described in this work if the server also supports TLS 1.2 cipher suites as s2n does. The issues identified in this work have since been addressed in s2n, partly in response to this work, and current versions are no longer vulnerable to the attacks described in this work. We stress that the problem we identify in s2n does not arise from reusing OpenSSL\u2019s crypto code, but rather from s2n\u2019s own attempt to protect itself against the Lucky 13 attack when processing incoming TLS records. It does this in two steps: (1) using additional cryptographic operations, to equalise the running time of the record processing; and (2) introducing random waiting periods in case of an error such as a MAC failure.\n\nIn case it's not clear to some readers, there's nothing wrong with writing a new implementation of a trusted crypto standard, especially when the work is followed up with the kind of security reviews Amazon sought with s2n. And as noted in the paper, most modern browsers are immune to Lucky 13 attacks. Still, some older e-mail programs and other legacy systems still rely on CBC and could have been susceptible when interacting with AWS, had it used the vulnerable s2n version. While the threat posed by an exploit of those vulnerabilities would have been low, the paper illustrates just how easy it is to make errors and how hard it is to get things right.\n\nPost updated to remove RC4 from the sixth paragraph and to quote from Amazon blog post. Language in the first, fourth, and last paragraphs changed to correct risk posed to users. The vulnerable version was never in production."}
{"26": "T-Mobile US today unveiled \u201cBinge On,\u201d a feature that will automatically reduce the quality of video while allowing many video services to stream without counting against customers\u2019 high-speed data limits.\n\nThe carrier said that videos will be capped at \u201cDVD or better quality,\u201d meaning they will generally be downgraded to 480p. Customers who want to stream at normal resolution and don\u2019t mind using their data can turn the feature off. Binge On will be available to new Simple Choice customers beginning Sunday and will be extended to existing T-Mobile customers starting Thursday, November 19. Further Reading Unlike AT&T, T-Mobile isn\u2019t charging companies to circumvent data caps Still, T-Mobile favors big content providers with unlimited music streaming.\n\nBinge On will be automatically enabled. Customers who want to shut it off must do so in their account settings at my.t-mobile.com. On family plans, Binge On can be disabled on a per-user basis if you want it enabled for some users but not others.\n\nThey key benefit of Binge On is that 24 video services, including Netflix, HBO, and Hulu, will stream without counting against data limits. But the video compression apparently applies to video regardless of whether it's from one of the services that are exempt from caps.\n\n\"Powered by new technology built in to T-Mobile\u2019s network, Binge On optimizes video for mobile screens, minimizing data consumption while still delivering DVD or better quality (e.g. 480p or better),\" the company said. \"That means more reliable streaming for services that stream free with Binge On, and for almost all other video [emphasis ours] it means T-Mobile Simple Choice customers can watch up to three times more video from their data plan.\"\n\nBased on the above and similar statements in a T-Mobile FAQ, it appears that nearly all video will be compressed unless customers shut the service off. With the service on, many videos won't count against caps, while others will count against the caps but won't use as much data as they normally would.\n\n\"If customers have Binge On turned on and use another service that isn\u2019t included for free, it will still be optimized and will allow them to use up to 3X as much data (so it would count against the allotment, but will be optimized),\" T-Mobile told Ars today.\n\nAs the FAQ notes, \"Every Simple Choice customer can watch 3 times more video with your data plan with Binge On enabled.... You can always choose to turn off Binge On, however, you will no longer have the ability to stream for free from your favorite streaming services or have video optimized for your smartphone screen resulting in higher usage of your high speed data.\"\n\nServices that won't count against data caps are Netflix, HBO Now, HBO Go, Hulu, Sling TV, Sling Box, ESPN, Showtime, Starz, Movieplex, Encore, Vevo, Vessel, Univision Deportes, Major League Baseball, Fox Sports, Fox Sports Go, NBC Sports, Crackle, Vudu, and Ustream. It'll work either in the providers' apps, or in mobile Web browsers.\n\nThe carrier\u2019s own T-Mobile TV is also exempted, as are videos from T-Mobile\u2019s rivals, namely Verizon\u2019s Go90 and AT&T\u2019s DirecTV.\n\nNotably absent is Google\u2019s YouTube. Google participates in T-Mobile\u2019s similar Music Freedom program, which exempts data from many music streaming services. We\u2019ve asked Google whether it plans to join Binge On and will provide an update if we get one.\n\nT-Mobile says it's \u201cnot a net neutrality problem\u201d\n\nMusic Freedom was criticized by some net neutrality advocates, who argue that Internet providers can influence what content consumers access by picking and choosing what counts against data caps.\n\nBut so-called \u201czero-rating\u201d services aren\u2019t outlawed by the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules. The rules allow for complaints against zero-rating schemes, with the commission judging on a case-by-case basis whether a practice \"unreasonably interferes\" with the ability of consumers to reach content or the ability of content providers to reach consumers.\n\n\u201cThis is not a net neutrality problem,\u201d T-Mobile US CEO John Legere said during today\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s free, the providers don\u2019t pay, the customers don't pay. Most importantly\u2026 you can shut it off, it\u2019s complete customer choice.\u201d\n\nBinge On uses a \u201cproprietary\u201d system to optimize video streams, Legere said. \u201cThis is open to any service that wants to come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone that can meet our technical criteria, we will include.\u201d T-Mobile will also take nominations from customers, just as it did with Music Freedom.\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge is concerned about Binge On. Instead of the carrier choosing which services don't count against caps, T-Mobile \"could put the choice of which services to zero-rate in customers' hands, not its own, or explore ways to allow customers to freely stream lower-quality media regardless of its source,\" Senior Staff Attorney John Bergmayer said. \"Under its current model, customers might choose to use a service simply because it doesn't count towards their data plans, rather on its merits.\"\n\nT-Mobile posted a comparison video to show what its optimized streams look like compared to full HD quality.\n\nBinge On does not work outside the US. When streaming over Wi-Fi or domestic roaming, video resolution \"defaults to the highest available,\" T-Mobile says.\n\nDoubling data allotments\n\nInstead of having hard data caps, T-Mobile\u2019s Simple Choice plans provide a limited amount of high-speed data and then throttle customers after they use it up. Customers who use up the allotment and any rolled over data can either purchase additional high-speed data or make do with slower speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle. Video and other data is throttled to 2G speeds once customers go through their allotments, T-Mobile told Ars. (There appears to be an exception for music.)\n\nAlso today, T-Mobile increased the amount of high-speed data in many plans. Simple Choice plans that offer 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB of high-speed data (for $50, $60, or $70 a month) will all be doubled to 2GB, 6GB, and 10GB, the carrier said. Family and business plans get the doubled data at no extra charge, T-Mobile said, while pricing for individual plans is altered a bit. The new plans will be available starting Sunday.\n\nThe 2GB plan is not eligible for Binge On's video data exemption, though it still gets the compression that can reduce video data usage. The free streaming is only for plans that have at least 3GB of data.\n\nThe unlimited plan for individuals will remain at $80 but will include 14GB of mobile hotspot data, as opposed to the current 7GB. (UPDATE: The unlimited data price is actually going up to $95.) Optimized videos from the 24 Binge On services won\u2019t count against the mobile hotspot allotment. Unlimited customers can claim a free movie rental from Vudu each month beginning in January, but only if they leave the Binge On optimization feature on.\n\nOne downside of the new Simple Choice plans is that Data Stash\u2014which lets you roll unused data over to future months for up to a year\u2014is capped at 20GB. Previous plans did not place any limits on how much data a customer could collect in Data Stash."}

There were students\u2014engineers, historians, archaeologists\u2014and Davison, a 26-year-old surfer-boy from Santa Cruz who only just graduated from university, one of those smart-asses who studied something quirky with underwater measurement.\n\n\"When we first met, they were so sure that I didn't have the slightest idea about what work really is,\" he remembers. But those experts, they underestimated their teacher. Not for nothing does Davison offer his classes in Iraq, Lebanon, and Afghanistan: there, people yearn to learn what he knows. His last lecture in Pakistan was packed, 30 people squeezed into the classroom.\n\nMost of them were researchers from the region, students, and activists. People who know the place, locals. \"They couldn\u2019t wait to use the tools I showed them,\" says Davison. \"One student proposed that we should secure an archaeological excavation site right away. The place is controlled by militias of the fundamentalist Taliban almost all year round.\"\n\nCultural guardians\n\nThe student who proclaimed this idea is part of a new generation of cultural guardians who are starting to make a name for themselves around the world as the digital \"Monuments Men.\" Originally the Monuments Men were a group of people, most of them with a cultural studies background, who joined a special branch of the US Army for one reason only: to save and retrieve stolen art from the Nazis. The goal of the digital Monuments Men today is no less important: they want to save global culture from destruction.\n\nAs a member of CyArk, Davison is providing tech and knowledge to those on-the-ground experts. The non-profit organisation has dedicated itself to digitising the UNESCO World Heritage sites. Within five years it plans to scan 500 cultural sites in order to transform them into digital 3D models. So far that has worked out quite well\u2014at least for easily accessible examples such as the Brandenburg Gate in Germany or ancient Corinth in Greece. In crisis areas, failed states, and autocracies this task is a lot harder.\n\nThe CyArk organisation uses just about every tool that high-technology has to offer: 3D scanners, drones of every size, 360-degree cameras, 3D printers, smart software, and virtual reality systems. It seems as if the idea is certainly causing some serious stir: over 250 ambassadors, government officials, experts, and activists from 35 countries attended CyArk's annual conference in Berlin this year.\n\nIn countries such as Syria, Iraq, or Libya thousands are fighting against the ongoing destruction of historical sites. They are working against time, against the environment, against natural catastrophes, and most of all against war. Since ISIS (ISIL, Daesh) started its mass destruction of historical and religious sites, the threat has become bigger. Not a week goes by without a new YouTube video popping up that shows monuments being blown into bits and pieces or destroyed by hammer-swinging terrorists.\n\nDavison and his students are supposed to respond to ISIS with a secret offensive\u2014and they've got the support of industrial and political elites.\n\nAt the CyArk conference this past October, Francesco Bandarin has clearly put a lot of effort into his presentation about the ongoing destruction of historical sites. The former head of the UNESCO World Heritage Centre is projecting it on the wall: one picture after the other in a seemingly never-ending series. The Desolation of Jerusalem's temple 79BC. The demolition of Cluny Abbey by French revolutionaries. The total destruction of cities like Coventry or Dresden during World War II. \"This all started way before ISIS,\" he says. Nowadays there are more conflicts on Earth than ever before\u2014therefore the destruction of culture has reached a new dimension. \"Wars are blind,\" says Bandarin.\n\nWhile speaking to experts and activists, one thing becomes clear: what has been done, and is being done right now to preserve these cultural sites, is not enough. Besides the destruction of places of cultural interest by airstrikes or ground combats, there is the looting. It is the number one cause of deterioration. There are no confirmed numbers; the black market, where artefacts are bought and sold, is just as obscure as the illegal weapons or drugs trade. There is, however, a common consensus, that ISIS is bargaining with looted goods. For the Islamist militias it is the most important income after oil.\n\nBandarin says that there's a global reporting system in cooperation with Interpol and the UNESCO Convention regarding the protection of heritage sites published decades ago, but neither measure has so far managed to solve the problem. \"90 percent of the artefacts are not from registered sites,\" Bandarin explains. And after it has looted them, ISIS destroys the source to cover its tracks. The culture is lost.\n\n\"Without the Arabian lute there would be no rock and roll.\"\n\nIf the digital Monuments Men had their way, there would be no covering of tracks. The activists are armed with notebooks, cameras, and smartphones. They are documenting everything that is still there. Merely the possession of those tools could cost them their lives.\n\n\"Through the destruction of those sites, ISIS also wants to eliminate memories,\" says Stefan Weber from the Museum of Islamic Art in Berlin. Anybody who wants to save those memories is an enemy in the eyes of the terror group and will be punished as such. \"If we succeed in saving old knowledge, for example with the help of 3D scanners, then we can counteract this growing amnesia,\" explains Weber. \"And memories are more than important, because without the Arabian lute there would be no rock and roll.\"\n\nThis is why CyArk announced a new project at its conference in October. It is also the mission that is sending Davison around the world. \"Project Anqa\" is a reaction to the destruction of the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra and the Mosul Museum in spring 2015. \"This requires an immediate response,\" says Gustavo Araoz, a board member at CyArk.\n\nNo one has a better technological understanding of how to deal with this matter than Davison. He studied underwater archaeology because he loves diving. It didn\u2019t take long before he became fascinated by the art of echo-sounding and reflection seismology. The first time he actually used it was in the Red Sea (pictured right). \"You can make 2D and 3D shots of the deepest terrain with this technology,\" he explains. To leave the water and apply the technology on the shore was an easy one. And the potential is huge.\n\n\"Five years ago we had to use diesel engines to keep the instruments running. A scanner could maybe do eight scans a day with ten million pixels.\" Today the batteries fit in one hand and the machines scan ten billion pixels\u2014per second. Newer techniques use algorithms that can even digitally restore destroyed ruins. The software also records alterations, for example the transformation of a mosque into a church and vice versa.\n\n\"The Technology is still pretty expensive, that is why we also show other possibilities to the activists in the field,\" says Davison. Just the journey alone to these heritage sites can be expensive or problematic."}

{"31": "T-Mobile US drew some criticism for a new program that exempts certain online video services from data caps, but Federal Communications Commission Tom Wheeler today praised the carrier's zero-rating plan. Further Reading T-Mobile exempts video from data caps, but lowers resolution to 480p Some video services won't count against caps, others will be \"optimized.\"\n\n\"Binge On\" exempts 24 services including Netflix, HBO, and Hulu from T-Mobile's high-speed data limits while downgrading quality of video to reduce data usage. The FCC's net neutrality rules don't specifically ban such zero-rating schemes, but they allow for complaints with the commission judging on a case-by-case basis whether a practice \"unreasonably interferes\" with the ability of consumers to reach content or the ability of content providers to reach consumers.\n\nIf anyone were to file a complaint against T-Mobile's video exemption, Wheeler doesn't seem likely to stop the practice.\n\n\"Its clear in the Open Internet Order that we said we are pro-competition and pro-innovation,\" Wheeler said today. \"Clearly this meets both of those criteria. It's highly innovative and highly competitive.\"\n\nWheeler made the statement after today's FCC meeting when a reporter asked him if Binge On raises any net neutrality concerns.\n\nVideo providers don't have to pay T-Mobile for placement in Binge On. T-Mobile also has a similar program for music streaming called Music Freedom.\n\nT-Mobile US CEO John Legere said Binge On is \"not a net neutrality problem\" when he announced the service, pointing out that it doesn't cost providers anything and consumers can shut it off if they prefer higher-quality video that counts against caps.\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge criticized T-Mobile, saying customers should be the ones to choose which services get zero-rated. \"Under its current model, customers might choose to use a service simply because it doesn't count towards their data plans rather on its merits,\" the group said.\n\nThe New York Times editorial board raised concerns, writing that \"Binge On is certainly better than plans in which websites pay telecom companies to be included. But it is not yet clear whether these free plans will inappropriately distort how consumers use the Internet.\"\n\nWheeler said that the FCC will keep an eye on Binge On, as it does with other programs that would be evaluated against the commission's net neutrality rules. AT&T has a \"Sponsored Data\" program that lets companies pay for data exemptions, and that seems to have avoided major FCC scrutiny.\n\nCritics of the FCC's rules said they would prevent innovation since companies have to seek permission from the commission before unveiling new offerings. Wheeler today said T-Mobile's Binge On proves that hasn't come to pass.\n\n\"I also chuckle at the fact that as we were debating this, everyone was saying, 'oh this is going to thwart innovation, it's going to be terrible, people are going to come to the FCC to say, \"mother, may I?\" before they do anything.' Well that certainly didn't happen here,\" Wheeler said.\n\nThe \"Mother, may I?\" line was used repeatedly by Republican FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai and industry group CTIA-The Wireless Association, which represents T-Mobile and other carriers.\n\nWe asked the FCC what it thinks about a new Comcast streaming video service that doesn't count against Comcast data caps, but a commission spokesperson declined comment."}
{"32": "\"Hand me a clamp, stat,\" a skinny guy in a white lab coat says with some urgency. An older man, who had been standing back from the messy melee, looks over the shoulder of the first man. \"Quick, the blood's going everywhere,\" he says. He's holding a syringe full of bright blue liquid.\n\n\"OK, OK,\" says another white-coated man, hurrying off. He returns a few seconds later. \"Got the clamp. And some gauze as well.\"\n\nI stand in the corner of the room for a few minutes and watch the men operate on the patient. Eventually, when everything seems to have stabilised, I cautiously take a step towards the workbench and assess the damage. \"Is it usually this messy?\" I ask, looking down at a mound of sodden tissues, pipes, pumps, and syringes.

The blood then need to be recharged. Sebastian Anthony It's alliiiive! Sebastian Anthony Or, well, actually it's a bit... dead. Sebastian Anthony The complete test setup. Sebastian Anthony This is kind of the precursor to IBM's 5D blood research: it's the water-cooled gallium-arsenide solar cell used in the Solar Sunflower.\n\nOne of the greatest problems facing the intertwined fields of computer science, electronic engineering, and information technology is density. Simply put, it is very, very hard to cram more and more digital functionality (compute, RAM, NAND flash, etc.) into a given volume of space. This might sound somewhat counterintuitive, considering how small modern computer chips are, but just think about it for a moment. Your desktop PC case probably has a volume of 50 litres or more\u2014but the CPU, GPU, RAM, and handful of other chips that actually constitute the computer probably account for less than 1 percent of that volume.\n\nIt isn't that chip designers and computer makers don't want to make better use of that empty space inside your computer, but currently it's technologically infeasible to do so. We can just about squeeze in two or three graphics cards by using liquid cooling and perhaps two high-end CPUs if you're feeling particularly sassy. Going beyond that is really difficult.\n\nIn recent years we've seen the rise of one method of increasing density: stacking one die or chip on top of another. Even there, though, it seems that chip companies are struggling to go beyond a two-high stack, with logic (CPU, GPU) at the bottom and memory on top, or perhaps four or eight stacks in the case of high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Despite fairly regular announcements from various research groups and semiconductor companies, and the maturation of 3D stacking (TSVs) and packaging technologies (PoP), multi-storey logic chips are rare beasts indeed.\n\nIn both cases\u2014cramming more graphics cards into your PC case or making a skyscraper chip with a dozen logic dies in the same package\u2014it is the same two problems that get in the way: heat dissipation and power delivery.\n\nLet's tackle the tricky topic of thermal dissipation first. Over the years, you may have noticed that the max TDP (thermal design power) of a high-end CPU hasn't really changed. It hit around 130W with the Pentium D in the mid-2000s... and then stopped. There are a number of complex reasons for this, but there are two that are the most pertinent for this story.\n\nFirst, as chips get smaller, there is less surface area that makes contact with the heatsink/water block/etc., which puts some fairly stringent limits on the absolute amount of thermal energy that can be dissipated by the chip. Second, as chips get smaller, hot spots\u2014clusters of transistors that see more action than other parts of the chip\u2014become denser and hotter. And because these hot spots are also getting physically smaller as transistors get smaller, they fall afoul of the first issue as well. The smaller the hot spot, the harder it is to ferry the heat away.\n\nNow imagine if you have two CPUs stacked on top of each other. With consumer-grade air or liquid cooling, we could probably prevent the top CPU from melting; but how on earth do you dissipate the heat produced by the lower CPU? And what happens if you stack hot spots on top of each other?\n\nThe other, lesser-known issue that prevents chip stacking is power delivery. Did you know that, on a modern CPU\u2014an LGA 1155 Ivy Bridge chip, for example\u2014the majority of those 1155 pins are used for power delivery? Take a look at the diagram above. All of the boxes that begin with \"V\"\u2014VSS, VCC\u2014are involved with delivering a stable flow of electricity to Ivy Bridge's 640 million transistors and other features.\n\nIf you want to stack one CPU on top of another, you not only have to increase the number of pins at the bottom of the chip, but you also have to find a way of connecting those power lines to the upper chip through the lower chip. This is incredibly difficult, and it's one of the main reasons that most 3D chip stacks, either via package-on-package (PoP) or TSV, have so far consisted of a CPU at the bottom and RAM on top. RAM is pretty much the opposite of a CPU, with most pins dedicated to data transfer rather than power delivery.\n\nListing image by Sebastian Anthony"}

VW did not immediately identify the vehicles in question.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nUS pollution regulators said late Monday that the Volkswagen emissions-test cheating scandal now includes Porsche, the brand that was run by VW's new CEO.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency said the cheating software to rig pollution tests was in 3.0 liter diesel engines in Audis and Porsches for model years 2014 to 2016.\n\n\"VW has once again failed its obligation to comply with the law that protects clean air for all Americans,\" Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator at the EPA's enforcement unit, said in a statement.\n\nThe agency said these diesel models contain the so-called \"defeat device\" cheating software: the 2014 VW Touareg; the 2015 Porsche Cayenne; and the 2016 Audi A6 Quattro, A7 Quattro, A8, A8L, and Q5.\n\nFurther Reading Volkswagen CEO resigns amid emissions scandal, Porsche CEO to take over [Updated] Martin Winterkorn said he was \"shocked by the events of the past few days.\" That the scandal has now hit Porsche calls into question VW's new chief executive, Matthias M\u00fcller. Before recently being elevated to VW's top position to clean up the emissions scandal, he was the head of Porsche.\n\nVW, however, disputed the EPA's assertion. The automaker said vehicles with the 3.0 liter diesel V6 engines \"had a software function which had not been adequately described in the application process.\" The company said it is working with US pollution regulators to \"clarify\" the situation.\n\n\"Volkswagen AG wishes to emphasize that no software has been installed in the 3-liter V6 diesel power units to alter emissions characteristics in a forbidden manner,\" VW said.\n\nThe EPA countered:\n\nVW's software on these vehicles includes one or more Auxiliary Emission Control Devices (AECD) that the company failed to disclose, describe and justify in their applications for certificate of conformity for each model. Every manufacturer must apply to EPA for and be approved for a certificate of conformity for each model each year, otherwise it is illegal to introduce the cars into commerce. An AECD designed to circumvent emissions test is a defeat device.\n\nPorsche also said it is innocent. \"We are surprised to learn this information. Until this notice, all of our information was that the Porsche Cayenne diesel is fully compliant,\" Porsche said in a statement.\n\nIn September, VW admitted that as many as 11 million diesel vehicles, from years 2009 to 2015, had the cheating software installed. The software would rig emissions tests by forcing the engine to pollute less during testing but allow the car to function much better and pollute more on the road. The US government said that the software allowed the vehicles to spew toxic nitrogen oxide up to nine times beyond EPA standards.\n\nFor its part, VW says it's a victim of \"rogue\" engineers who tinkered with the software unbeknownst to VW executives. The company insists this \"was not a corporate decision.\"\n\nThe automaker has set aside as much as $7.4 billion to address the scandal, which includes criminal investigations on both sides of the pond.\n\nThe latest revelations affect about 10,000 cars in the US."}

{"37": "NEW YORK\u2014Late last month, National Geographic Channel and Uber teamed up to promote a new series on scientific breakthroughs\u2014called, appropriately enough, Breakthrough\u2014and they chose to do it with a fleet of alternative energy vehicles on the streets of Manhattan. Obviously we've got a healthy interest in forward-looking cars here at Ars, so it seemed like a good idea to hop on a train to check out what all the fuss was about. The fleet of cars included some running on biodiesel, E85 ethanol, and even a fuel cell-powered Hyundai, but one car more than any other was top of our list for a passenger ride: the McLaren P1 hypercar.\n\nI know what you're probably thinking at this point. \"Manhattan's streets sound like a terrible place to try out the mighty McLaren,\" and we certainly didn't blame its owner for being apprehensive about threading his 903hp (673kW) machine through dense city traffic. But a couple of hours in the passenger seat proved the Big Mac more than up for the job, even if it was designed for the race track rather than commuting.\n\nYou would be forgiven for thinking of the P1 as a successor to the legendary McLaren F1 of the mid-1990s, but the car was actually designed with a quite different purpose in mind. The F1 was designer Gordon Murray's idea of the world's best car, capable of carrying a driver and two passengers across continents in comfort and at high speed. True, it did go racing and win Le Mans in 1995\u2014but it was adapted to the track, not designed for it. By contrast, the P1 was created to be \"the best driver's car in the world on road and track,\" according to McLaren, and it uses a lot of lessons the company has learned from its racing in Formula 1 to do so.\n\nThe sport moved to hybrid powertrains in 2009, and so the P1 is also a hybrid, coupling a 727hp (542kW) turbocharged 3.8L V8 with a single electric motor, good for 176hp (131kW). However, unlike the first hybrid Formula 1 cars or other hybrid sports cars like the Porsche 918 Spyder or BMW i8, the P1 doesn't recapture kinetic energy under deceleration. Instead, the 4.7kWh battery is charged by excess power from the internal combustion engine (ICE) whenever you lift off the gas (you can plug it into the wall as well).\n\nJennifer Hahn The P1 heads toward 1WTC, Ars' NYC home. Jennifer Hahn The P1 heads toward 1WTC, Ars' NYC home. Jonathan Gitlin The McLaren P1 drew more than a little attention on its outing to NYC. Jonathan Gitlin We happened upon another one of the promotional cars in Manhattan, a Lexus RXh Hybrid Electric Crossover SUV. McLaren A schematic of the P1's powertrain. McLaren A McLaren P1 outside the McLaren Technology Centre in Woking. McLaren The McLaren Technology Centre was designed to be 80-percent NASA, 20-percent Disneyland. It succeeded.\n\nClever onboard electronics decide how to juggle the application of all that power, although the P1 can also run as a pure EV for a few miles. There's also the option to give the driver control of the electric motor via a button on the steering wheel to use as a boost, similar to the first iterations of hybrid Formula 1 cars. Still, the prevailing wisdom is that it's more sensible to trust all that to the car's ECUs.\n\nFurther Reading The wild weird world of carbon fiber How can something that starts out like cloth end up being so strong and light?\n\nThe P1's V8 actually shares quite a bit with McLaren's other road cars. The engine is a derivative of the one that first appeared in the MP4-12C (now found in the 650S, 675LT, and forthcoming 570S), albeit with a fair amount more power. The carbon fiber chassis (called a MonoCage) is also closely related to the MonoCell used by the 12C, 650S, and 675LT, although in the P1 it also includes an integral roof structure. Unlike the earlier F1 road car\u2014which was the first production car to have a carbon fiber chassis\u2014the MonoCage was made by resin transfer molding. This process, also used by the BMW i8, is much more rapid than the laborious pre-preg method used in the F1, although McLaren used this method for the body panels as well as the stunning interior.\n\nAll 375 P1s were built in the McLaren Technology Centre, the organization's extremely high-tech HQ in Woking, just outside London. We were fortunate enough to visit the MTC last week on a trip to the UK, and even though production of the P1 has now finished, there were several people hard at work in one of the glass-walled workshops putting the finishing touches to replacement body panels (that looked like carbon fiber sculptures) just a few feet away from a similar workshop where the Formula 1 race cars are constructed.\n\nLike McLaren's other road cars, the P1 was assembled in the McLaren Production Centre, a car factory like no other. For one thing, it's spotless, with white floor tiles, walls, and lots of natural light, much like the workshops in the main MTC building where the race cars come from. And almost everything is done by hand, with cars being passed off from one worker to another as they move through the 371,355-square-foot (34,500m2) building.\n\nFun fact According to Operations Director Alan Foster, the MPC is ever so slightly smaller than originally designed by architect firm Foster + Partners. McLaren CEO Ron Dennis calculated that if it was 198m long and 99m wide, instead of the planned 200m by 100m, the 218,000 ceramic tiles (and their grouting) would fit perfectly without a single tile needing to be cut. That level of attention to detail is present throughout McLaren, both in the cars and its facilities.\n\nThe P1 also benefits from a lot of tech that's too cutting edge for F1, including active aerodynamics and brake-steer instead of a conventional limited slip differential. That last one uses the rear brakes to slow the inside wheel during cornering, developed by McLaren for its 1998 Formula 1 car until the system was banned by the sport's organizers. The car's carbon ceramic brakes (made by Akebono) are coated in silicon carbide, and they are more than up to the task of slowing what is one of the very fastest cars on the planet.\n\nUnlike previous generations of super- or hypercar, modern-control electronics allow cars that would previously have been extremely specialized to now change behavior at the twist of a knob. The P1's suspension setup, which McLaren calls RaceActive Chassis Control, uses hydropneumatics to control the ride. Each wheel has actuators with two nitrogen-filled pistons, one to control roll and one for heave, handling each separately. McLaren doesn't believe in antiroll bars but instead constantly reads the car's attitude on the road, tweaking the dampers to keep the car as level as possible. It even compensates for having a passenger in the car.\n\nWhat that means is with the suspension set to Normal, the P1 actually copes extremely well with the rough and broken roads of lower Manhattan. Coupled with the car's extremely good forward visibility, the owner's apprehension about driving the car in New York's artificial canyons didn't materialize. He was also able to give us a very small glimpse into the car's performance while keeping things appropriate for the conditions. On track, the P1 is capable of hitting 62mph (100km/h) in 2.8 seconds, 124mph (200km/h) in 6.8 seconds, and 186mph (300km/h) in just 16.5 seconds.\n\nSadly the P1 is out of reach for most of us. The cars\u2014which are all sold out\u2014started at $1,350,000 before taxes, a price that's as extreme as its performance. For the 375 owners fortunate enough to own one, they have a very special car. Thankfully, a lot of the P1's DNA is also present in the \"cheaper\" cars in McLaren's range. In the coming weeks, you'll be able to read our review of the 650S supercar, and the company is just starting production on the entry-level 570S, which we also hope to bring you in the new year.\n\nListing image by Jennifer Hahn"}
{"38": "\"Let's play Global Thermonuclear War.\"\n\nThirty-two years ago, just months after the release of the movie WarGames, the world came the closest it ever has to nuclear Armageddon. In the movie version of a global near-death experience, a teenage hacker messing around with an artificial intelligence program that just happened to control the American nuclear missile force unleashes chaos. In reality, a very different computer program run by the Soviets fed growing paranoia about the intentions of the United States, very nearly triggering a nuclear war.\n\nThe software in question was a KGB computer model constructed as part of Operation RYAN (\u0420\u042f\u041d), details of which were obtained from Oleg Gordievsky, the KGB's London section chief who was at the same time spying for Britain's MI6. Named for an acronym for \"Nuclear Missile Attack\" (\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u042f\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u041d\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435), RYAN was an intelligence operation started in 1981 to help the intelligence agency forecast if the US and its allies were planning a nuclear strike. The KGB believed that by analyzing quantitative data from intelligence on US and NATO activities relative to the Soviet Union, they could predict when a sneak attack was most likely.\n\nAs it turned out, Exercise Able Archer '83 triggered that forecast. The war game, which was staged over two weeks in November of 1983, simulated the procedures that NATO would go through prior to a nuclear launch. Many of these procedures and tactics were things the Soviets had never seen, and the whole exercise came after a series of feints by US and NATO forces to size up Soviet defenses and the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 on September 1, 1983. So as Soviet leaders monitored the exercise and considered the current climate, they put one and one together. Able Archer, according to Soviet leadership at least, must have been a cover for a genuine surprise attack planned by the US, then led by a president possibly insane enough to do it.\n\nWhile some studies, including an analysis some 12 years ago by historian Fritz Earth, have downplayed the actual Soviet response to Able Archer, a newly published declassified 1990 report from the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB) to President George H. W. Bush obtained by the National Security Archive suggests that the danger was all too real. The document was classified as Top Secret with the code word UMBRA, denoting the most sensitive compartment of classified material, and it cites data from sources that to this day remain highly classified. When combined with previously released CIA, National Security Agency (NSA), and Defense Department documents, this PFIAB report shows that only the illness of Soviet leader Yuri Andropov\u2014and the instincts of one mid-level Soviet officer\u2014may have prevented a nuclear launch.\n\nThe balance of paranoia\n\nAs Able Archer '83 was getting underway, the US defense and intelligence community believed the Soviet Union was strategically secure. A top-secret Defense Department-CIA Joint Net Assessment published in November of 1983 stated, \"The Soviets, in our view, have some clear advantages today, and these advantages are projected to continue, although differences may narrow somewhat in the next 10 years. It is likely, however, that the Soviets do not see their advantage as being as great as we would assess.\"\n\nThe assessment was spot on\u2014the Soviets certainly did not see it this way. In 1981, the KGB foreign intelligence directorate ran a computer analysis using an early version of the RYAN system, seeking the \"correlation of world forces\" between the USSR and the United States. The numbers suggested one thing: the Soviet Union was losing the Cold War, and the US might soon be in a strategically dominant position. And if that happened, the Soviets believed its adversary would strike to destroy them and their Warsaw Pact allies.\n\nThis data was everything the leadership expected given the intransigence of the Reagan administration. The US' aggressive foreign policy in the late 1970s and early 1980s confused and worried the USSR. They didn't understand the reaction to the invasion of Afghanistan, which they thought the US would just recognize as a vital security operation.\n\nThe US was even funding the mujaheddin fighting them, \"training and sending armed terrorists,\" as Communist Party Secretary Mikhail Suslov put it in a 1980 speech (those trainees including a young Saudi inspired to jihad by the name of Osama bin Laden). And in Nicaragua, the US was funneling arms to the Contras fighting the Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega. All the while, Reagan was refusing to engage the Soviets on arms control. This mounting evidence convinced some in the Soviet leadership that Reagan was willing to go even further in his efforts to destroy what he would soon describe as the \"evil empire.\"\n\nUSSR had plenty of reason to think the US also believed it could win a nuclear war. The rhetoric of the Reagan administration was backed up by a surge in military capabilities, and much of the Soviet military's nuclear capabilities were vulnerable to surprise attack. In 1983, the United States was in the midst of its biggest military buildup in decades. And thanks to a direct line into some of the US' most sensitive communications, the KGB had plenty of bad news to share about that with the Kremlin. Further Reading 50 years to orbit: Dream Chaser\u2019s crazy Cold War backstory The reusable mini-spaceplane is back from the dead\u2014again\u2014and prepping for space.\n\nThe seaborne leg of the Soviet strategic force was especially vulnerable. The US Navy's SOSUS (sound surveillance system), a network of hydrophone arrays, tracked nearly every Russian submarine that entered the Atlantic and much of the Pacific, and US antisubmarine forces (P-3 Orion patrol planes, fast attack subs, and destroyers and frigates) were practically on top of, or in the wake of, Soviet ballistic missile subs during their patrols. The US had mapped out the \"Yankee Patrol Boxes\" where Soviet Navaga-class (NATO designation \"Yankee\") ballistic missile subs stationed themselves off the US' east and west coasts. Again, the Soviets knew all of this thanks to the spy John Walker, so confidence in their sub fleet's survivability was likely low.\n\nThe air-based leg of the Soviet triad was no better off. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union had the largest air force in the world. But the deployment of the Tomahawk cruise missile, initial production of the US Air Force's AGM-86 Air Launched Cruise Missile, and the pending deployment of Pershing II intermediate range ballistic missiles to Europe meant that NATO could strike at Soviet air fields with very little warning. Unfortunately, the Soviet strategic air force needed as much warning as it could get. Soviet long-range bombers were \"kept at a low state of readiness,\" the advisory board report noted. Hours or days would have been required to get bombers ready for an all-out war. In all likelihood, the Soviet leadership assumed their entire bomber force would be caught on the ground in a sneak attack and wiped out.\n\nEven theater nuclear forces like the RSD-10 Pioneer\u2014one of the weapons systems that prompted the deployment of the Pershing II to Europe\u2014were vulnerable. They generally didn't have warheads or missiles loaded into their mobile launcher systems when not on alert. The only leg not overly vulnerable to a first strike by NATO was the Soviets' intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force. Its readiness was in question, however. According to the 1990 briefing paper by the PFIAB, about 95 percent of the Soviet ICBM force was ready to respond to an attack alert within 15 minutes during the early 1980s. The silo-based missiles were out of range of anything but US submarine-launched and land-based ballistic missiles.\n\nThe viability of the ICBM force as a response to sneak attack was based entirely on how much warning time the Soviets had. In 1981, they brought a new over-the-horizon ballistic missile early warning (BMEW) radar system on-line. One year later, the Soviets activated the US-KS nuclear launch warning satellite network, known as \"Oko\" (Russian for \"eye\"). These two measures gave the Soviet command and control structure about 30 minutes' warning of any US ICBM launch. But the deployment of Pershing II missiles to Europe could cut warning time to less than eight minutes, and attacks from US sub-launched missiles would have warning times in some cases of less than five minutes.\n\nAnd then, President Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) or \"Star Wars\" program\u2014the predecessor to the current Missile Defense Agency efforts to counter limited ballistic missile attacks. While SDI was presented as defensive, it would likely only be effective if the US dramatically reduced the number of Soviet ICBMs launched by making a first strike. More than ever before, SDI convinced the Soviet leadership that Reagan was aiming to make a nuclear war against them winnable.\n\nCombined with his ongoing anti-Soviet rhetoric, USSR leadership saw Reagan as an existential threat against the country on par with Hitler. In fact, they publicly made that comparison, accusing the Reagan administration of pushing the world closer to another global war. And maybe, they thought, the US president already believed it was possible to defeat the Soviets with a surprise attack."}
{"39": "Widespread in Russia, dashcams are also starting to proliferate on US streets. Frequently you'll read about them on Ars in the context of police brutality at traffic stops, and who could forget the footage from Chelyabinsk of a meteorite impact in 2013 that taught us our estimates of asteroid damage were inadequate? So after Vantrue was kind enough to offer one of its R1 Pro dashcams for an extended trial, we jumped at the chance to see what life with a dashcam was really like.\n\nIt's quite boring, as it turns out. We installed the camera into a Saab 9-2X that spends much of its time on the roads in Washington DC, including a 20-mile commute three times a week. We figured this gave us pretty good odds of at least recording something interesting over the course of about two months. It's well known throughout the region that you need to watch out for Maryland drivers, and traffic in the DC metro area, and particularly the Beltway (I-495, a freeway that circles the city), is among the worst in the nation.\n\nThe R1 Pro itself is intuitive to set up and use, and relatively inexpensive at about \u00a3100. It records at 1080p, 30FPS in two aspect ratios: 21:9 and 16:9, saving everything to a microSD card. A G sensor in the camera automatically saves clips that include an impact event; in practice this meant quite a few short clips of the camera being attached to its mount, a couple of it falling off the mount, and then a few minutes of stop-start traffic. Other footage is wiped as the R1 Pro records on a loop.\n\nAfter reviewing all this footage, the most exciting thing on the memory card came from the day we used the 9-2X as a chase car for our McLaren 650S review. There was not a single police stop, no asteroids threatening to end civilisation, nor anything involving almost-certainly drunk Russian drivers. (This is probably a good problem to have considering the alternatives.)\n\nOur video cache ultimately makes it hard to draw many conclusions about the personal utility of such devices. We could see potential for those of you who spend your days driving for work, though. Of course, dashcam apps for smartphones are also available, but not everyone wants to fill their phone with footage of traffic, nor dedicate it to the role of panopticon when in the car. So to answer the question of whether we'd recommend one, it's hard to find a reason to do so unless you need dashcam footage. Thankfully our experience of the US has largely been less lawless than Russia, but we are aware it's a big country. We'd love to hear your experiences of using dashcams in the comments, and if you've got any footage you want to share, the more the merrier.\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica"}
{"40": "Stanford researcher Mark Jacobson likes to take current thinking about renewable energy and supersize it. Rather than aiming for 50 percent renewables, like California is, he has analyzed what it would take for each of the 50 states to go fully renewable. It would apparently involve so many offshore wind turbines that hurricanes headed toward the States would be suppressed.\n\nFurther Reading Massive offshore wind farms\u2019 unexpected benefit: Hurricane protection Wind speed, storm surge slashed when there are 10,000 turbines in storms' path.\n\nNow, he and a few collaborators are back with a more detailed look at how to manage the grid stability issues that come with large amounts of intermittent generators, like photovoltaic panes and wind turbines. Normally, issues of intermittency are expected to be handled by fossil fuel power and batteries. But the new analysis suggests we don't need any of that\u2014and we don't need biofuels or nuclear, either. Instead, it suggests we could manage a 100-percent renewable grid through a combination of hydrogen production and heat storage.\n\nNone of this is entirely new. People have been talking about generating hydrogen from renewable energy for years\u2014with a fuel cell, it can be used to power cars or generate electricity as needed. And the paper cites an existing community that's already using solar energy to generate heat that's stored under ground. But, as with Jacobson's past analyses, they are taken to new scales here.\n\nIn the example mentioned above, solar energy is used to heat water, which is then pumped to an underground heat exchanger. There, it transfers heat to the soil, raising its temperature to as high as 80 degrees Celsius. When the heat is needed, the process is simply reversed. In the new plan, similar things would be done with cooling, depending on the needs at a location.\n\nHeat would also play a significant role in electrical storage, typically coupled to solar-thermal generation. Rather than using molten salt, however, the new plan suggests using phase-change materials that can store much more energy while keeping a fairly narrow temperature range.\n\nThe other main form of storage would be hydropower. Rather than viewing existing dams as a baseline power source, the renewable grid would treat them as a form of stored power and only draw down the water when absolutely needed. They'd be supplemented by pumped hydro storage.\n\nBeyond that, there's hydrogen. Every spare bit of electricity that isn't used would go into producing it through electrolysis. It would then be used for transport, industrial processes that require high temperatures, and to generate electricity when intermittent sources aren't operating at full capacity. Transportation would also be handled by electric vehicles.\n\nA lot of things would have to change to make this work. To begin with, we'd need to separate out things like heat, hot water, and cooling from the rest of our energy loads, since they'd be supplied through local storage systems\u2014which we'd also have to build. Electricity would require demand-response to better balance load with supply, and the grid would have to be updated to allow more long-distance transmission.\n\nWe would also need a massive build-out of renewable power sources. We currently have a bit over 40,000 large wind turbines in the US; in the new scenario, we'd need roughly 500,000. There's very little hydrogen production and no infrastructure for distributing it. That would have to change dramatically. This would require lots of catalysts (which are expensive and contain rare metals) and sufficient fresh water for those catalysts to split.\n\nNevertheless, if we could do all of this by 2050 (the study's target year), it would work. The authors link a weather model to an energy demand model and update it every 30 seconds for six years. The results suggest that this setup could fully meet the demands that we expect on the grid by that year.\n\nThe authors suggest that its full cost (including externalities) would be about $0.1137 for each kiloWatt-hour. That is competitive with a conventional grid's business costs ($0.106/kW-hr). But health and climate externalities more than double the true cost to $0.276/kW-hr, making the all-renewable grid relatively economical.\n\nFrankly, the whole thing seems unrealistic. Even building out existing technologies on this sort of scale would likely run into materials shortages that would raise prices. And, in several of these cases, like phase-change heat storage materials, the technology simply hasn't been commercialized yet. Plus, things like solar thermal generation are having a hard time competing against cheap photovoltaics now. For all those reasons, this scenario is overwhelmingly unlikely to happen and would probably be more expensive than this analysis would suggest.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the analysis was a waste of time. The tools developed for it could be very valuable for planning a grid that has higher levels of renewable power. And the issues it identifies can help policymakers decide which technologies need further research or incentives to foster commercialization.\n\nPNAS, 2015.

{"41": "Windows 10 collects more data and has more cloud connections than any version of Windows before\u2014a design that has many privacy implications. One of the continued complaints around this is a lack of clarity around what gets collected and how it gets used. Ed Bott spotted that the privacy statement, the lengthy document covering all of Microsoft's major online services, was updated in October.\n\nSome of the changes are straightforward corrections or updates to accommodate new service names. Others, however, are a bit more meaningful. For example, on consumer systems the encryption keys used for BitLocker drive encryption by default get backed up to OneDrive online. These enables data recovery in certain situations. The description of this in the privacy statement has been updated to note that \"Microsoft doesn't use your individual recovery keys for any purpose\" making clear that while the keys may be stored on OneDrive, Microsoft will not use them and is not interested in decrypting your disk.\n\nAnother alteration clarifies language that was being misinterpreted. The original privacy statement read that Microsoft \"will access [...] your content (such as [...] files in private folders)\" in response to law enforcement demands, to ensure safe operation of its services, and a few other situations. This led some to believe that private folders on users' hard disks were vulnerable to inspection and distribution by Microsoft. The new text makes it explicit that only files stored on OneDrive and e-mails stored in Outlook.com are covered by this statement.\n\nThe mandatory collection of telemetry data has also been a concern, with many businesses operating under regulations that strictly prohibit dissemination of personal information. While the Enterprise version of Windows 10 allows telemetry to be disabled entirely, the Pro version, which is also widely used in corporate environments, does not. Microsoft told Bott that Windows 10 remains compatible with FINRA, SEC, and FTC regulations when telemetry is configured at the \"Basic\" level. At the Basic level, the data collected only covers basic hardware and software stats and so does not include any personal data.\n\nThe complaints about Windows 10's privacy policy will, no doubt, continue to rage; the inability to disable telemetry on most versions of Windows, along with only limited control of the installation of updates still represent a marked difference when compared to prior versions of Windows. However, the updated privacy statement does represent progress. It addresses some of the worse fears, and provides greater clarity about what Microsoft is doing, why it's doing it, and what constraints it applies."}

It\u2019s like a superpower. It\u2019s like having X-ray vision.\u201d\n\nDebbie\u2019s not alone in her enthusiasm for neuroplasticity, which is what we call the brain\u2019s ability to change itself in response to things that happen in our environment. Claims for its benefits are widespread and startling. Half an hour on Google informs the curious browser that neuroplasticity is a \u201cmagical\u201d scientific discovery that shows that our brains are not hard-wired like computers, as was once thought, but like \u201cplay-doh\u201d or a \u201cgooey butter cake.\" This means that \u201cour thoughts can change the structure and function of our brains\u201d and that by doing certain exercises we can actually, physically increase our brain\u2019s \u201cstrength, size, and density.\" Neuroplasticity is a \u201cseries of miracles happening in your own cranium\u201d that means we can be better salespeople and better athletes and learn to love the taste of broccoli. It can treat eating disorders, prevent cancer, lower our risk of dementia by 60 percent and help us discover our \u201ctrue essence of joy and peace.\" We can teach ourselves the \u201cskill\u201d of happiness and train our brains to be \u201cawesome.\" And age is no limitation: neuroplasticity shows that \u201cour minds are designed to improve as we get older.\" It doesn\u2019t even have to be difficult. \u201cSimply by changing your route to work, shopping at a different grocery store, or using your non-dominant hand to comb your hair will increase your brain power.\u201d As the celebrity alternative-medicine guru Deepak Chopra has said, \u201cMost people think that their brain is in charge of them. We say we are in charge of our brain.\u201d\n\nDebbie\u2019s story is a mystery. The techniques promising to change her brain via an understanding of the principles of neuroplasticity have clearly had tremendous positive effects for her. But is it true that neuroplasticity is a superpower, like X-ray vision? Can we really increase the weight of our brain just by thinking? Can we lower our risk of dementia by 60 percent? And learn to love broccoli?\n\nSome of these seem like silly questions, but some of them don\u2019t. That\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s hard, for the non-scientist, to understand what exactly neuroplasticity is and what its potential truly is. \u201cI\u2019ve seen tremendous exaggeration,\u201d says Greg Downey, an anthropologist at Macquarie University and co-author of the popular blog Neuroanthropology. \u201cPeople are so excited about neuroplasticity they talk themselves into believing anything.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cscience of the future\u201d\n\nFor many years, the consensus was that the human brain couldn\u2019t generate new cells once it reached adulthood. Once you were grown, you entered a state of neural decline. This was a view perhaps most famously expressed by the so-called founder of modern neuroscience, Santiago Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. After an early interest in plasticity, he became sceptical, writing in 1928, \u201cIn adult centres the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the future to change, if possible, this harsh decree.\u201d Cajal\u2019s gloomy prognosis was to rumble through the 20th century.\n\nAlthough the notion that the adult brain could undergo significant positive changes received sporadic attention, throughout the 20th century, it was generally overlooked, as a young psychologist called Ian Robertson was to discover in 1980. He\u2019d just begun working with people who had had strokes at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh and found himself puzzled by what he was seeing. \u201cI\u2019d moved into what was a new field for me, neuro-rehabilitation,\u201d he says. At the hospital, he witnessed adults receiving occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Which made him think\u2026 if they\u2019d had a stroke, that meant a part of their brain had been destroyed. And if a part of their brain had been destroyed, everyone knew it was gone for ever. So how come these repetitive physical therapies so often helped? It didn\u2019t make sense. \u201cI was trying to get my head around, what was the model?\u201d he says. \u201cWhat was the theoretical basis for all this activity here?\u201d The people who answered him were, by today\u2019s standards, pessimistic.\n\n\u201cTheir whole philosophy was compensatory,\u201d Robertson says. \u201cThey thought the external therapies were just preventing further negative things happening.\u201d At one point, still baffled, he asked for a textbook that explained how it all was supposed to work. \u201cThere was a chapter on wheelchairs and a chapter on walking sticks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut there was nothing, absolutely nothing, on this notion that the therapy might actually be influencing the physical reconnection of the brain. That attitude really went back to Cajal. He really influenced the whole mindset which said that the adult brain is hardwired, all you can do is lose neurons, and that if you have brain damage all you can do is help the surviving parts of the brain work around it.\u201d\n\nBut Cajal\u2019s prognosis also contained a challenge. And it wasn\u2019t until the 1960s that the \u201cscience of the future\u201d first began to rise to it. Two stubborn pioneers, whose tales are recounted so effectively in Doidge\u2019s bestseller, were Paul Bach-y-Rita and Michael Merzenich. Bach-y-Rita is perhaps best known for his work helping blind people \u2018see\u2019 in a new and radically different way. Rather than receiving information about the world from the eyes, he wondered if they could take it in in the form of vibrations on their skin. They\u2019d sit on a chair and lean back on a metal sheet. Pressing up against the back side of that metal sheet were 400 plates that would vibrate in accord with the way an object was moving. As Bach-y-Rita\u2019s devices became more sophisticated (the most recent version sits on the tongue), congenitally blind people began to report having the experience of \u2018seeing\u2019 in three dimensions. It wasn\u2019t until the advent of brain-scanning technology that scientists began to see evidence for this incredible hypothesis: that information seemed to be being processed in the visual cortex. Although this hypothesis is yet to be firmly established, it seems as if their brains had rewired themselves in a radical and useful way that had long been thought impossible.\n\nMerzenich, meanwhile, helped to confirm in the late 1960s that the brain contains \u2018maps\u2019 of the body and the outside world, and that these maps have the ability to change. Next, he co-developed the cochlear implant, which helped deaf people hear. This relies on the principle of plasticity, as the brain needs to adapt to receive auditory information from the artificial implant instead of the cochlea (which, in the deaf person, isn\u2019t working). In 1996 he helped establish a commercial company that produces educational software products called Fast ForWord for \u201cenhancing the cognitive skills of children using repetitive exercises that rely on plasticity to improve brain function,\u201d according to their website. As Doidge writes, \u201cIn some cases, people who have had a lifetime of cognitive difficulties get better after only thirty to sixty hours of treatment.\u201d\n\nAlthough it took several decades, Merzenich and Bach-y-Rita were to help prove that Cajal and the scientific consensus were wrong. The adult brain was plastic. It could rewire itself, sometimes radically. This came as a surprise to experts like Robertson, now a Director of Trinity College Dublin\u2019s Institute of Neuroscience. \u201cI can look back on giving lectures at Edinburgh University to students where I gave wrong information, based on the dogma which said that, once dead, a brain cell cannot regenerate and plasticity happens in early childhood but not later,\u201d he says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the publication of a series of vivid studies involving brain scans that this new truth began to be encoded into the synapses of the masses. In 1995, neuropsychologist Thomas Elbert published his work on string players that showed the \u2018maps\u2019 in their brain that represented each finger of the left hand\u2014which they used for fingering\u2014were enlarged compared to those of non-musicians (and compared to their own right hands, not involved in fingering). This demonstrated their brains had rewired themselves as a result of their many, many, many hours of practice. Three years later, a Swedish\u2013American team, led by Peter Eriksson of Sahlgrenska University Hospital, published a study in Nature that showed, for the very first time, that neurogenesis\u2014the creation of new brain cells\u2014was possible in adults. In 2006, a team led by Eleanor Maguire at the Institute of Neurology at University College London found that the city\u2019s taxi drivers have more grey matter in one hippocampal area than bus drivers, due to their incredible spatial knowledge of London\u2019s maze of streets. In 2007, Doidge\u2019s The Brain that Changes Itself was published. In its review of the book, the New York Times proclaimed that \u201cthe power of positive thinking has finally gained scientific credibility.\" It went on to sell over one million copies in over 100 countries. Suddenly, neuroplasticity was everywhere.\n\nListing image by Brea Souders at East Photographic"}
{"44": "A government task force that is helping to plan a national drone registration system says the registration process should be simple and free, because onerous requirements could hinder the market for small unmanned aircraft. Further Reading Got a drone? You\u2019ll have to register it with the US government \"Registering unmanned aircraft will help build a culture of accountability.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's drone registration task force recommended a three-step registration process. \"Any registration steps more burdensome than these three simple steps may jeopardize the likelihood of widespread adoption,\" the task force said in its final report, dated November 21.\n\nThe FAA will take the recommendations under advisement before making a final decision.\n\nPeople would only have to register once, even if they have multiple drones, if the recommendation is adopted by the FAA. Drones weighing 250 grams or less shouldn't have to be registered, the task force recommended, saying it came up with the weight-based exclusion \"based primarily upon an assessment of available safety studies and risk probability calculations.\" The recommended registration process would apply to drones weighing up to 55 pounds.\n\nFederal law says no one can operate an aircraft unless it is registered with the FAA, but the agency is not yet enforcing the requirement for small drones used for hobby or recreational purposes. With drone adoption increasing rapidly, the government announced last month that purchasers of drones will have to register the devices and set up a task force to make recommendations for the creation of a registration process.\n\nThe recommended process was summarized as follows:\n\n1) Fill out an electronic registration form through the Web or through an application (app).\n\n2) Immediately receive an electronic certificate of registration and a personal universal registration number for use on all sUAS [small unmanned aircraft systems] owned by that person.\n\n3) Mark the registration number (or registered serial number) on all applicable sUAS prior to their operation in the NAS [National Airspace System].\n\nThe task force included companies like 3D Robotics, Amazon, Best Buy, Google, GoPro, DJI, and Wal-Mart; industry groups such as the Academy of Model Aeronautics, the Aerospace Industries Association, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, the American Association of Airport Executives, the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International, the Consumer Technology Association, and the General Aviation Manufacturers Association; and other groups including the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and the National Association of State Aviation Officials.\n\nTask force members had \"often very divergent views,\" and settled on the simple registration process in part because anything else \"would undermine the overall registration philosophy that enabled the Task Force to come to consensus,\" the report said.\n\nUnder the task force's recommendation, drone purchasers would have to enter their name and street address into the registration form. \"Provision of e-mail address, telephone number, and serial number of the aircraft into the system would be optional. Information on US citizenship or residence status would not be required, but there would be a minimum age requirement of 13 years to register,\" the report said.\n\nDrone operators would have to mark their registration number on each aircraft prior to outdoor operation. But the recommendation suggests that this requirement could be waived if the person registering their drones provided the FAA each device's serial number.\n\n\"If a registrant chose to provide the FAA with the aircraft\u2019s serial number, the registrant would not be required to further mark the sUAS with the FAA-issued registration number, as long as the serial number meets the requirement of being readable, legible, and readily accessible (without the use of tools) upon visual inspection,\" the task force said.\n\nPenalties for not registering should not be severe, the task force said. \"Current registration-related penalties (perhaps exceeding $25,000) were established in order to address and deter suspected drug traffickers and tax evaders who failed to register aircraft as part of larger nefarious schemes,\" the report said. The task force said there should instead be a \"reasonable and proportionate penalty schedule\" for consumers and juveniles who inadvertently violate the new requirements."}

{"46": "House Science Committee Chair Rep. Lamar Smith's (R-Texas) latest allegation against NOAA climate scientists was that the organization's recent research study was \u201crushed.\u201d\n\nFurther Reading Congressman claims NOAA whistleblowers told him climate study was rushed NOAA denies the study was hurried for political reasons.\n\nThat study has repeatedly drawn the ire of Rep. Smith because it concluded that slower surface temperature warming between 1998 and 2014 was mostly an artifact of error in the dataset. The journal Science published it in June, but Rep. Smith found the results suspicious because new EPA emissions regulations were finalized in August. However, the paper had entered the peer-review process in December 2014, and the updated sea and land surface temperature data that were used had already been published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nIn a Washington Post story this morning, a spokesperson for Science confirmed there was nothing rushed about the paper\u2019s publication. It comes as no surprise, seeing as NOAA has no say whatsoever in operations at Science. In fact, the spokesperson noted that the paper took about 50 percent longer than average to reach publication, and it went out to more than the usual three reviewers.\n\nThe Washington Post also talked to an author of the study who retired from NOAA in July about the \"rushed\" accusations. Thomas Peterson, who is now at the World Meteorological Organization, explained that there had been some tension between researchers and computer engineers behind the code that worked through weather stations on land for abnormalities. The engineers wanted to keep testing their code, and the researchers chafed at the wait. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a time lag of years between the science and when they thought the software testing would be ready because of this question of whether one piece of software might develop a glitch,\u201d Peterson told the paper. The submission of that dataset for peer review in early 2013 was apparently delayed six months for that software testing.\n\nIf this is the \u201crush\u201d that Rep. Smith is referring to, it relates to the land surface temperature dataset, which was simply expanded to include more stations. That change had very little to do with the increase in the warming trend since 1998. The reported warming was almost entirely due to the updated sea surface temperature data.\n\nOn Thursday, the leading Democrat on the House Science Committee, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, sent a second letter excoriating Rep. Smith\u2019s investigation. Describing the accusations that this study was rushed, she writes, \u201cThis mild accusation would hardly seem to warrant the hyper-aggressive oversight and rhetoric you have leveled at NOAA.\u201d"}
{"47": "I can see the future, and it's here... today! I can see the future, and it's here... today! Do not be afraid. I am not a cyborg. I am just enjoying a virtual reality world. This is the pose you'll actually take much of the time when using the Gear VR. Despite the bulky protrusion from the front of your head, the Gear VR is actually pretty comfortable to wear for extended periods.\n\nAbout a year ago, Samsung and Oculus released the Gear VR \"Innovator Edition,\" a phone holster/virtual reality headset that straddled the line between dev kit and early adopter hardware. This month, Samsung updated that early access hardware to a bona fide consumer product; the new Gear VR is the first explicitly consumer-facing offering from Oculus in its more than three years of public existence as a company.\n\nWe've had a few days now to play around with that retail hardware, enough time to determine that Oculus and Samsung have squeezed an impressive virtual reality experience out of common smartphone hardware and a relatively cheap headset. At \u00a3100, the consumer Gear VR is a no-brainer for anyone who already uses a compatible Samsung Galaxy phone. For everyone else, it's an impressive bit of technology that could be a deciding factor when choosing your next phone.\n\nSuperb comfort\n\nThe biggest refinements in the consumer Gear VR over last year's Innovator Edition come in increased comfort. The headstrap has been completely redesigned. The curved, cushioned hard plastic of last year's model has been replaced with a relatively simple elastic strap behind the head and an optional, rigid fabric strap over the top of the skull. The new design makes the unit easier to adjust for a comfortable fit thanks to velcro pads that now bend properly around the hinges.\n\nThe consumer edition also shaves about 70 grams off the 380 gram weight of last year's edition. That might not sound very significant, but it's definitely noticeable, and it's important in a device whose weight is carried by sensitive parts of your face and skull. The 2015 Samsung Galaxy phones that work with the consumer Gear VR (the Note 5, S6, S6 Edge, and S6 Edge+) are also a few grams lighter than the Galaxy Note 4 that was used in last year's model, adding to the apparent weight difference.\n\nThe consumer edition (left) looks the tiniest bit sleeker than last year's Innovator Edition. The consumer edition (left) looks the tiniest bit sleeker than last year's Innovator Edition. There's been the slightest reduction in thickness in the consumer-ready update (left). Note how the consumer version (left) doesn't separate the cutouts for the two eye lenses. Also note the additional divot for the nose, allowing the phone to get closer to the face. The consumer edition has a two-way switch to accommodate phones of different sizes. The consumer edition (near) has a slightly extended \"visor\" atop the lens area. This shot shows just how much has changed about the touchpad on the side of the consumer version (left). The pillowy eye cushioning on the consumer edition (left) is much more comfortable than the foam rubber on last year's Gear VR. The velcro-attached eye cushioning comes off easily for cleaning, adjustment, or replacement. The small sensor that detects when the Gear VR is pressed against a face has been moved from the corner on last year's edition (left) to the center on the consumer version. Those vents on the bottom of the consumer version (right) help the phone in the Gear VR run cooler and with less screen fogging.\n\nThe consumer edition Gear VR also sports newly designed cushioning around the eyes. This padding resembles a fabric-covered stuffed pillow more than the harsh, rubbery foam on last year's model. Samsung and Oculus have also added some discrete vents underneath the eye area for the consumer model. These allow for enough airflow to prevent the occasional fogging that plagued the Innovator Edition and make the phone less likely to overheat after prolonged use. The downside to this change is that the vents let in some additional light from below, causing the slightest bit of glare in dark scenes.\n\nAll these changes combine to make the consumer edition of the Gear VR much more comfortable than the Innovator Edition, which was already relatively comfortable. Compared to last year, there's much less pressure around the eyes and on the back of the skull. The hardware isn't exactly light enough to forget about altogether, but I was able to easily wear it for an hour at a time without any desire to pull it off to let my face breathe or rest my eyes. If the Innovator Edition felt like a pair of snug ski goggles, the consumer Gear VR feels more like a pair of extra-chunky sunglasses resting on the bridge of your nose.\n\nThe new Gear VR also comes with changes to the touchpad on the side of the headset, which acts as the main tangible input for most VR apps. The touch area is larger now, with a more noticeable lip to indicate the edge of the touch-sensitive area. More importantly, there's now a cross-shaped divot cutout to guide your finger through swipes in the cardinal directions and a raised pip in the middle of the pad to serve as a central tap point.\n\nOn the one hand, these changes make it much easier to find the touchpad when feeling around blindly on the side of the headset. They also make it easier to figure out where precisely your finger is resting when you do tap and swipe. On the other hand, it's a bit annoying having swipes across the touch surface interrupted by these rough raised and lowered sections. I found myself missing the long, smooth swipes I could make unperturbed on the Innovator Edition's uninterrupted surface.\n\nSurprising performance\n\nIf your only experience with mobile phone VR has been the cheap-by-design Google Cardboard or strap-on plastic holsters that merely hold a smartphone in front of your face, you owe it to yourself to see the difference the Gear VR makes. The added tilt-sensing hardware and other processing offered by this \u00a3100 headset makes the virtual world around you seem much more solid and stable than the bare bones sensors in a standard smartphone can provide.\n\nCombine that additional hardware with the quick-refreshing AMOLED screens on the Samsung Galaxy line, and you get the ability to look around 360-degree 3D environments with no discernible lag between your head movement and the change in your VR viewpoint. And because the Gear VR and phone form a self-contained portable headset, there are no worries about wires getting in the way or tethering you to a certain point in the room.\n\nWe tested the consumer Gear VR with the Galaxy 6+ Edge. That has the same size screen, resolution, and pixels per inch as the Galaxy Note 4 we used with the Innovator Edition a year ago, so the visual experience was, unsurprisingly, not very different.\n\nThe resolution is still just above the minimum that's viable for a comfortable virtual reality experience; there's only a slight, hazy \"screen door effect\" in the space between pixels and some slightly noticeable jagged edges on angled lines. Your experience may actually improve a bit with the Galaxy S6 or S6 Edge, each of which has a higher pixel density. (The extra GB of RAM on the S6 Edge+ seemed to improve loading times slightly, as well.)\n\nThe consumer version comes in a much smaller, more retail-friendly package. The consumer version comes in a much smaller, more retail-friendly package. Close-up on the box. The back-of-the-box copy does a pretty poor job of selling the VR experience. Oh man, I can't wait to play Realistic VR Game. It's getting great reviews. Inside the box, a tightly packed plastic shell. Two straps and an instruction/warning booklet are all you get with the headset. Bring your own phone.\n\nThe main issue hampering the Gear VR's ability to deliver totally engrossing VR, as with the Innovator Edition, is that there's still no positional head tracking. If you lean your head or body forward or side to side, the entire virtual world comes sickeningly along with you rather than staying solidly in place as you move through.\n\nApp makers can design around this problem to some extent, but users still have to be careful not to shift their position too much. While Gear VR does support standard Bluetooth controllers, there's no built-in support for any kind of hand-tracking solution available in other upcoming VR headsets. For most apps, instead of reaching in and messing with the world, you're limited to looking around and interacting by using your head as a kind of virtual mouse pointer.\n\nThen there's the field of view\u2014a relatively limited 96 degrees. This is narrow enough that the black edges of the virtual view are somewhat apparent in your peripheral vision even when you're focused straight ahead, and those edges are definitely noticeable if you shift your eyes left or right. It's easy to forget about this problem when you're engrossed in a well-designed 3D VR world, and you quickly learn to simply turn your head rather than darting your eyes to see things to the side. Still, the tunnel vision effect does limit the sense of presence a bit.\n\nThe S6 Edge+ battery seems to last for about four hours of constant VR use, comparable to what the Note 4 got on the Innovator Edition. The consumer Gear VR also includes a pass-through USB plug, however, letting you charge the phone as you explore the virtual world. This is especially convenient if you have a portable USB charger that you can place in your pocket or lap to avoid getting tangled as you rotate.\n\nImpressive, entry-level consumer VR\n\nWe'll have more in-depth analysis of the most compelling VR apps available for Gear VR soon. For now, though, we're comfortable calling Oculus' first consumer product a comfortable and surprisingly powerful entry-level virtual reality experience. If you're already part of the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem and have a compatible phone, \u00a3100 is a steal to try it out. I wouldn't recommend buying an expensive Galaxy phone just to try it, but if you're considering a new phone and have any interest in trying out virtual reality at home, the Gear VR should be an important factor in your decision.\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica"}
{"48": "The Neolithic Revolution involved the advent of agriculture, which finally allowed people to settle down in ever-larger groups and focus on things other than procuring calories\u2014things like developing written language and forming social cliques. It was one of the most profound events in the collective history of humanity.\n\nBut it wasn't just social change. It was a change in the evolutionary environment that shaped the human genome. The genetic variation found in different populations on the globe today provides hints to the ways we all adapted. But analyzing ancient DNA could allow us to identify traits as they adapted in real time.\n\nAlas, ancient human DNA has been pretty sparse. Now, an international team of geneticists, archaeologists, and anthropologists has assembled a database of genomes from 230 West Eurasians who lived between 6500 and 300 BCE and found evidence of selection at genetic loci involved in diet, pigmentation, immunity, and height.\n\nThe database consists of previously published and new samples. Critically, it includes the genomes of 26 Anatolian Neolithic farmers, examined for the first time here. (Their DNA was obtained from the inner-ear region of the petrous bone, which yields twice as much DNA as teeth.) To study selection, the researchers compared over a million sites in the chromosomes that are known to vary within human populations. The researchers looked at both the ancient DNA and in genome-wide sequencing data from four populations of European ancestry in the 1,000 Genomes Project.\n\nBy far the strongest signal for selection is at the SNP responsible for lactase persistence, a variant that allows adults to digest milk sugars, located on chromosome 2. The allele first appears in an individual who lived in central Europe around 4,000 years ago.\n\nOther diet-related alleles selected for include two that decrease blood plasma triglyceride levels, which come from a meat-rich diet. Two others regulate circulating vitamin D levels, and another two are associated with celiac disease. One of these celiac-associated SNPs occurs in the gene encoding the ergothionine transporter, which helps import a relative of key amino acids. This is hypothesized to have undergone a selective sweep to protect against ergothionine deficiency in those switching from hunter-gatherer to more agricultural diets.\n\nAfter lactase, the next strongest signal contributes to light skin pigmentation. This SNP, on chromosome 5, is almost fixed in present-day Europeans but was much less frequent in the ancient genomes. Alleles for light eye color were also selected for, although not nearly as markedly.\n\nThere was also a strong signal for selection at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus on chromosome 6. MHC proteins are essential in adaptive immunity and for preventing autoimmune reactions. Adaptive immunity may have become more critical to humans who were living in the larger and larger groups, enabled by agriculture; perhaps autoimmune disorders are part of the price humanity must pay for the enhanced immune vigilance necessary for living en masse.\n\nThis study suggests that the height differences between current northern and southern Europeans has been doubly selected for: early Neolithic migrants to southern Europe were under selection for decreased height compared to other contemporaneous populations, while the steppe populations that eventually migrated to northern Europe were selected to be taller than others.\n\nNatural selection is a force that shapes all living things, fitting them into their environments and allowing them to survive environmental stressors. Selection and adaptation have been witnessed and recorded as they occur in many species: finches in the Galapagos, cichlids in the East African Great Lakes, and of course MRSA and other pathogenic bacteria as they learn to evade our antibiotics. Humans work no differently from these other forms of life; now that we can purify and analyze DNA throughout history, we can see how our genes evolved to help us adapt to our environments.\n\nNature, 2015.

Checks of more than 3,000 other Model S EVs haven't revealed another faulty seat belt.\n\nThis kind of corporate behavior is notable in an industry where OEMs often have to be pressured into issuing safety recalls after a series of high-profile problems or lawsuits.\n\nIf you own a Model S and have concerns about your seatbelts and haven't yet had time to have your car inspected, Tesla says, \"you may be able to detect this condition by pulling very firmly on the lap portion of your seat belt with a force of at least 80 pounds. This procedure may detect an improperly attached seat belt, but performing this procedure does not replace the need for an inspection by a Tesla technician.\""}
{"52": "After just six days on the market, LG has cancelled its latest smartwatch, the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE. An LG representative tells Android Police that due to \"a hardware issue\" the company has had to halt sales of the device.\n\nLG told the site, \"Late in the quality assurance process for the LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, our engineers were made aware of a hardware issue which affects the day-to-day functionality of the device. After further investigation, the decision was made to cancel the rollout of the Urbane 2nd Edition LTE due to the complicated nature of the issue.\"\n\nWe were able to confirm the cancellation with LG. The company hasn't gone into detail about what exactly is wrong with the device, but we were told that there was \"no danger to the user,\" and \"there are no safety issues or concerns with the product.\" LG told both Ars and Android Police that it had not yet decided if the device would ever be for sale again.\n\nThe Urbane 2nd Edition LTE was Android Wear's first watch with built-in LTE and the first (and so far only) Android Wear watch to ship with Marshmallow. The watch even got a big plug on Google's official Android blog last week.\n\nThe watch has been on sale for about six days, both online and in Verizon and AT&T stores. Today, the online listings from both carriers are gone: Verizon's page for the Urbane 2nd Edition LTE shows an error message that aptly notes \"Oops! That wasn't supposed to happen...,\" and AT&T redirects customers to a page for the first LG Watch Urbane. The watch also seems to be scrubbed from LG's site. We haven't heard of a recall yet, but if you happened to buy an Urbane 2nd Edition LTE, we'd suggest trying to return it."}

{"56": "It turns out your home security camera may see more of your home than you thought it did. In a teardown of the Nest Cam, a team at ABI Research found that even when \"off,\" the camera draws nearly the same amount of power as when it's fully powered on, meaning it's functional and running even when the indicator light claims otherwise.\n\nWithin the Nest Cam app, there is a \"Camera On/Off\" toggle, which many may think controls the camera's capture of video. However, the ABI team and Jim Mielke, vice president of teardowns at ABI Research, found that the home security camera doesn't draw much less power when it's \"off.\" \"In this case, the current drain only changed slightly when given the turn off command, reducing from 370mA to 340mA. Typically a shutdown or standby mode would reduce current by as much as 10 to 100 times. This means that even when a consumer thinks that he or she is successfully turning off this camera, the device is still running.\"\n\nThis may be unsettling for those who own Nest Cams and believed they were totally shutting down the camera when they turned it off from within the app. However, Nest doesn't deny that this is true\u2014a spokesperson for Nest Labs told the BBC in a statement, \"When Nest Cam is turned off from the user interface (UI), it does not fully power down, as we expect the camera to be turned on again at any point in time.\"\n\nWhile it doesn't change the potential security risks that come along with an \"always-on\" camera observing your living room, that explanation makes sense when you understand what \"on\" and \"off\" mean in terms of the Nest Cam. Turning the camera on in the app means the Nest Cam is actively looking for motion and sound to alert you to\u2014and capturing video while it does so. It doesn't disassociate motion and sound detection from the camera's functionality, so when the camera is on, the Nest Cam is on high alert for disturbances in your home. Of the handful of home security cameras I've recently reviewed, the one that does have an explicit option to turn off the camera is the Canary\u2014it has three modes of watchfulness, with one being \"Privacy: Camera and microphone are completely off.\"\n\nThe Nest Cam may be watching, but according to the company, that doesn't mean that footage is going anywhere. The same Nest spokesperson told the BBC, \"When Nest Cam is turned off, it completely stops transmitting video to the cloud, meaning it no longer observes its surroundings.\" Really, it's no longer actively observing and looking for things to ping your smartphone about, but it also shouldn't transmit that video elsewhere. Nest Labs also made a point to note that the camera uses 128-bit secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption, perfect forward secrecy, and a 2,048-bit RSA key that is different for each camera. These precautions make sure your video data can't be accessed, even over the local Wi-Fi network."}
{"57": "Underscoring just how hard it is to design secure cryptographic software, academic researchers recently uncovered a potentially serious weakness in an early version of the code library protecting Amazon Web Services.\n\nIronically, s2n, as Amazon's transport layer security implementation is called, was intended to be a simpler, more secure way to encrypt and authenticate Web sessions. Where the OpenSSL library requires more than 70,000 lines of code to execute the highly complex TLS standard, s2n\u2014short for signal to noise\u2014has just 6,000 lines. Amazon hailed the brevity as a key security feature when unveiling s2n in June. What's more, Amazon said the new code had already passed three external security evaluations and penetration tests.\n\nFurther Reading Two new attacks on SSL decrypt authentication cookies Aging standard isn't holding up very well in face of sophisticated attacks. Amazon's June 30 announcement was only a few hours old when Royal Holloway, University of London Professor Kenny Paterson and his colleagues met for lunch at a nearby pub to discuss the security of s2n. Five days later, they presented Amazon engineers with a report showing that the newly unveiled s2n was vulnerable to \"Lucky 13,\" a TLS attack unveiled in 2013 that made it possible to recover encrypted browser cookies used to access restricted parts of a website. Amazon engineers promptly fixed the errors. In a blog post, Amazon officials said the the vulnerable version of s2n was never used in production and that the proof-of-concept attacks \"did not impact Amazon, AWS, or our customers, and are not the kind that could be exploited in the real world.\"\n\nBy Paterson's estimates, attackers would need to observe about 223, or about 8.39 million, encrypted sessions to recover one byte of plaintext. To a layperson, that may sound like an insurmountable challenge. To cryptographers safeguarding the Web, it was an unacceptable risk. Ironically, in addition to the compact size of s2n and the completion of three external reviews, engineers also put in custom-designed safeguards to harden the TLS implementation against Lucky 13 exploits.\n\n\"Our work highlights the challenges of protecting implementations against sophisticated timing attacks,\" Paterson and colleague Martin Albrecht wrote in a research paper published Monday. \"It also illustrates that standard code audits are insufficient to uncover all cryptographic attack vectors.\"\n\nLucky 13 exploits a subtle timing bug in a TLS mode known as cipher block chaining. Paterson and other researchers behind the Lucky 13 attack discovered CBC-based streams could be manipulated in a way that reveals a limited amount of the plaintext in an encrypted data stream. The plaintext leaked through the timing of error messages that were produced when the modified ciphertexts were processed at a server. The exploit required attackers to receive thousands of different encryptions of the same message. With careful statistical processing, noise in the different timing samples could be eliminated, revealing the target plaintext bytes.\n\nIn Monday's paper, Paterson and Albrecht wrote:\n\nWe show that s2n\u2014as initially released\u2014was vulnerable to a timing attack on its implementation of CBC-mode ciphersuites. Specifically, we show that the two levels of protection offered against the Lucky 13 attack in s2n at the time of first release were imperfect, and that a novel variant of the Lucky 13 attack could be mounted against s2n. The attack is particularly powerful in the web setting, where an attack involving malicious client-side Javascript (as per BEAST, POODLE and Lucky 13) results in the complete recovery of HTTP session cookies, and user credentials such as BasicAuth passwords. In this setting, an adversary runs malicious JavaScript in a victim\u2019s browser and additionally performs a Person-in-the-Middle attack. We note, though, that many modern browsers prefer TLS 1.2 AEAD cipher suites avoiding CBC-mode, making them immune to the attack described in this work if the server also supports TLS 1.2 cipher suites as s2n does. The issues identified in this work have since been addressed in s2n, partly in response to this work, and current versions are no longer vulnerable to the attacks described in this work. We stress that the problem we identify in s2n does not arise from reusing OpenSSL\u2019s crypto code, but rather from s2n\u2019s own attempt to protect itself against the Lucky 13 attack when processing incoming TLS records. It does this in two steps: (1) using additional cryptographic operations, to equalise the running time of the record processing; and (2) introducing random waiting periods in case of an error such as a MAC failure.\n\nIn case it's not clear to some readers, there's nothing wrong with writing a new implementation of a trusted crypto standard, especially when the work is followed up with the kind of security reviews Amazon sought with s2n. And as noted in the paper, most modern browsers are immune to Lucky 13 attacks. Still, some older e-mail programs and other legacy systems still rely on CBC and could have been susceptible when interacting with AWS, had it used the vulnerable s2n version. While the threat posed by an exploit of those vulnerabilities would have been low, the paper illustrates just how easy it is to make errors and how hard it is to get things right.\n\nPost updated to remove RC4 from the sixth paragraph and to quote from Amazon blog post. Language in the first, fourth, and last paragraphs changed to correct risk posed to users. The vulnerable version was never in production."}

Andrew Cunningham The back of the laptop has a brushed metal finish that can look brownish or purplish depending on how you look at it. Andrew Cunningham The bottom of the laptop. Note bottom-mounted speakers. Andrew Cunningham The keyboard. This shot is from the UX305F, the Broadwell version of the laptop, but the two are identical. Andrew Cunningham Small, hard plastic nubs keep the back of the lid from touching your desk. Andrew Cunningham But they also lift the rear rubber feet up, making the laptop slide around more than it ought to. Andrew Cunningham On the left: two more USB 3.0 ports and an SD card reader. Andrew Cunningham On the right: headphones, micro HDMI, USB 3.0, and power. Andrew Cunningham The Zenbook doesn't taper much\u2014it's roughly uniform in thickness throughout. This is the Broadwell version of the XPS 13 (top) stacked on top of the Broadwell version of the Zenbook. Andrew Cunningham The large bezels of the UX305 series make it larger than laptops like the XPS 13.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to find cheap PCs and it\u2019s easy to find good PCs, but it can be difficult to find a PC in between those two poles that gives you a really great value for your money. Too often, you\u2019ll find PCs in the $600-700 range that aren\u2019t portable enough, or that use bad LCD panels, or that give you too-small SSDs or too-slow HDDs.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason we liked Asus\u2019 Zenbook UX305 laptop so much. It was never the best laptop you could buy, but it gave you a whole lot for $700. There are some odd design touches, and its trackpad, like so many Windows PC trackpads, is mediocre at best. It doesn\u2019t include a touchscreen. But the keyboard is good, the screen is good, and it\u2019s as fast as it needs to be. In other words, Asus made most of the right compromises, and the Skylake version of the laptop delivers the same stuff with improved performance.\n\nLook and feel\n\nAsus didn\u2019t change a thing about the way the Skylake version of the UX305 looks, which is mostly a good thing. It\u2019s still a mostly metal laptop with a burgundy or dark purple finish (it looks different depending on the way the light hits it), with a smooth matte texture on the palm rest and bottom of the laptop and a brushed metal texture on the lid.\n\nSpecs at a glance: Asus Zenbook UX305C Screen 1920\u00d71080 at 13.3\" (166 PPI) OS Windows 10 x64 CPU 900MHz dual-core Intel Core m3-6Y30 (Turbo up to 2.2GHz) RAM 8GB 1866MHz LPDDR3 (non-upgradeable) GPU Intel HD 515 (integrated) HDD 256GB SATA III solid-state drive Networking 867Mbps 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0 Ports 3x USB 3.0, micro HDMI, SD card reader, headphones Size 12.76\" \u00d7 8.9\" \u00d7 0.48\" (324 mm \u00d7 226 mm \u00d7 12.3 mm) Weight 2.65 lbs (1.2 kg) Battery 45Whr Warranty 1 year Starting price $699.00 Price as reviewed $699.00 Other perks Webcam\n\nLike so many Ultrabooks, it\u2019s created more or less in the image of the MacBook Air, right down to the chiclet keyboard. Construction is solid and free of creaking or flexing, and the keyboard itself feels great\u2014nice and clicky with a good amount of travel and a no-nonsense layout. It\u2019s not backlit, unfortunately, but that\u2019s one of the acceptable compromises that the Zenbook makes.\n\nYou still get a respectable-but-not-staggering number of ports, too: three USB 3.0 (two on the left, one on the right), a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, and a micro HDMI port. We would have preferred some kind of DisplayPort connector rather than HDMI\u2014the HD 515 GPU in Skylake Core M processors can drive a 4K display at 60Hz over DisplayPort, but because it still uses HDMI 1.4 it\u2019s limited to 24Hz over HDMI. This use case won\u2019t matter to everyone, but, since most people will need some kind of adapter to connect this to standard HDMI displays anyway, I\u2019d have preferred a DisplayPort-based port rather than micro HDMI.\n\nIf you just want a straightforward laptop without a touchscreen, there\u2019s very little to complain about when it comes to the Zenbook\u2019s display panel. 1080p at 13.3 inches (166 PPI) isn\u2019t quite Retina level, but it\u2019s more than sufficient for just about anything, and, since it\u2019s an IPS panel, you get nice color and great viewing angles that you don\u2019t see in so many low-end laptop screens. It\u2019s significantly better than the MacBook Air, which at this point needs to either get an upgrade or step aside in favor of a remodeled Skylake MacBook. And while I noticed some uneven backlighting and backlight bleed in the UX305 I tested earlier this year, I didn\u2019t see any in the Skylake version (though this could be normal unit-to-unit variance, and your screen could still look different from mine).\n\nIf you want touch and an even higher-resolution screen, there appears to be a version equipped with a 3200\u00d71800 touchscreen available for around $100 more that\u2019s floating around out there. Just be aware that the extra resolution will likely come at the expense of battery life. Regardless of the model you get, the large-ish screen bezels make the UX305 series physically larger than laptops like the recently redesigned XPS 13\u2014I don't mind larger bezels all that much, but it's something to keep in mind if you want the smallest device you can get with a 13-inch screen.\n\nOne bad thing I\u2019ve noticed about the finish as I\u2019ve used the UX305 for a bit longer is that it picks up fingerprints very easily, and that it\u2019s prone to chipping if you\u2019re not careful with it. The review loaner spent most of its time either on a desk or table or in my laptop bag, and it still managed to pick up a couple of tiny chips that mar the otherwise pleasant paint job.\n\nAdditionally, some design quirks from the older model have gone unaddressed. The bottom edge of the lid still props the laptop up when you have the screen open, lifting two of the laptop\u2019s rubber feet up off of your desk and making it less stable. The hard plastic nubs that keep the rim of the laptop from getting damaged also seem like they could scratch up your desk if they slide around too much.\n\nAnd finally, the trackpad still sort of sucks. It\u2019s not universally sucky\u2014it actually handles finger tracking and some of Windows 10\u2019s new trackpad gestures pretty well. But right clicking using the lower-right corner of the trackpad is finicky. Tap-to-click behaves erratically, particularly if you\u2019re trying to double-click something or click anything multiple times in rapid succession. And those trackpad gestures are a mixed bag. If you just want to quickly swipe (swiping up and down to enter and exit Task View, for example), it\u2019s fine. If you need to do scrolling with multiple fingers, though (swiping through visible Task View apps to switch between them), it\u2019s harder to get it to work as intended unless you\u2019re being very slow and deliberate about it.

{"59": "In recent years, SpaceX has upended the rocket industry. Whereas established rocket companies like United Launch Alliance and Arianespace once scoffed at the California upstart, the success of SpaceX has them rapidly scrambling to cut their own launch costs and pursue reusable rockets.\n\nSpaceX has also had an uneasy relationship with NASA. One one hand, the company\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, broke down in tears in late 2008 when a $1.6 billion contract from NASA to supply the International Space Station saved his company.\n\nAt the same time, Musk has said repeatedly that his ultimate aim with SpaceX is to land humans\u2014perhaps even himself\u2014on Mars. NASA also has a program to land humans on Mars. And just as NASA is building a heavy lift rocket to begin to accomplish this, so is SpaceX. Only its Falcon Heavy rocket will likely cost about one-tenth as much to launch as NASA\u2019s Space Launch System; it will begin flying two years sooner as well.\n\nThis has placed NASA in an uncomfortable position. Should it compete with the private sector? Can it compete with the private sector? For Lori Garver, who spent four years as NASA\u2019s deputy administrator from 2009 to 2013, there\u2019s an easy answer: No.\n\nDuring a panel discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations last Thursday, Garver recalled the attitude at NASA when Musk announced he was building his Falcon Heavy rocket, which would enable the private company to send missions beyond low-Earth orbit and into deep space.\n\n\u201cThe NASA people would say, \u2018Come on Lori, you\u2019ve got to talk to Elon because we got out of low-Earth orbit. We\u2019re giving him that, but you\u2019ve got to get him out of long-term, deep space, because that\u2019s ours,\u2019\u201d Garver recalled. \u201cI thought, fundamentally, you just don\u2019t understand. We\u2019re not in a race in a swimming pool where everyone is racing against one another. We\u2019re in a cycling race where the government is riding point and the others are drafting behind us, and if someone comes alongside us and can pass us because they\u2019ve found a better way, we don\u2019t get out our tire pump and stick it between their spokes.\u201d\n\nDuring her tenure as NASA\u2019s deputy administrator, Garver made more than a few enemies in Congress and at NASA. She stepped on the toes of center directors. She got crosswise with the astronaut corps. And she didn\u2019t always play nice with NASA\u2019s traditional aerospace partners, who expected fat contracts from the space agency but also flexible deadlines.\n\nGarver noted that NASA\u2019s Congressionally mandated Space Launch System, or SLS rocket, is being built by traditional contractors with traditional accounting measures. It's also powered by 1970s technology, space shuttle engines, and solid-rocket boosters. It is so expensive to build and fly that NASA can only afford to launch it about once every other year. None of it is reusable.\n\nPrivate rocket companies, meanwhile, are building modern engines\u2014generally smaller and more efficient rockets\u2014and making strides in efforts to recover and reuse their boosters. Their overarching goal is to reduce the cost of reaching space.\n\n\u201cYou have lots of people who grew up with Apollo and want to build the biggest rocket,\u201d Garver said. \u201cSo my question would be, who said the public would pay for you to do that when there are other ways to do that that would be more efficient? It is the public\u2019s money. But Congress has jobs in their district, and NASA has largely become a jobs program. We built an infrastructure with the Apollo program that we\u2019re trying to keep because that is in particular districts. It is one of the reasons I was focused on expanding commercial advancements.\u201d\n\nWhile Garver praised NASA for investing in SpaceX, Boeing, Orbital ATK, and other private ventures to deliver provisions and eventually crew members to the International Space Station, the space could be doing much more with the private sector.\n\nFurther Reading Quietly, the new space race between SpaceX and Boeing burns hot Whichever company flies astronauts first in 2017 gains bragging rights.\n\nThat\u2019s because during the last 10 years, outside investors such as Musk, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Virgin\u2019s Richard Branson, and many others have brought new ideas and money the aerospace industry. NASA should be investing in the basic technologies that private companies can then develop in cost-effective ways to really open up space. But instead, she said, Congress has directed NASA to take a top-down, centralized government approach.\n\n\u201cNASA was a very symbol of capitalist ideals when we went to the Moon and beat the Russians,\u201d she said. \u201cNow what we\u2019re working with is more of a socialist plan for space exploration, which is just anathema to what this country should be doing. Don\u2019t try to compete with the private sector. Incentivize them by driving technologies that will be necessary for us as we explore further.\u201d\n\nAnother panel member, Charles Miller, a former consultant to NASA and advocate of commercial space, largely agreed with Garver. By building the large SLS rocket, Miller said, NASA is betting on large appropriations in future years that will enable it to undertake a massive, Apollo-like approach to landing on Mars. The problem, Miller said, is that NASA has not been able to command that kind of budget since the 1960s, when the space agency\u2019s goals were aligned with the country\u2019s national security aims to undermine the Soviet Union.\n\n\u201cWe have a clear, stark choice that most people really don\u2019t understand,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really stark. You can either control where the jobs are and make sure they\u2019re in your district, which many politicians with control of the purse strings of NASA do, or you can let go of control. There\u2019s going to be the same amount of jobs, but there\u2019s going to be a lot more dynamic innovation. And we\u2019re going to achieve our national goals in space of putting humans into the solar system. With the first choice, we\u2019re just not going to get there.\u201d\n\nNASA\u2019s present policies are unlikely to change during the next year to 18 months. However, a new president may reassess NASA\u2019s SLS rocket, which is not due to fly until 2018 at the earliest. Although there has been little overt talk of space policy during the 2016 Presidential campaign, a change in approach is certainly possible. Garver was Hillary Clinton\u2019s closest advisor on space policy during the 2008 election, and some of the Republican candidates favor further commercialization of the space industry."}
{"60": "Welcome to Ars UNITE, our week-long virtual conference on the ways that innovation brings unusual pairings together. Today, we examine the evolution of solar and how business\u2014not tech\u2014may be holding it back. Join us this afternoon at 1pm Eastern (10am Pacific) for a live discussion on the topic with article author John Timmer and his expert guest; your comments and questions are welcome.\n\nIn the US, the future of solar energy will be made in California. Earlier this month, the state's governor signed legislation that commits California to obtaining half of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030. And to some extent, that future is now\u2014the state's utilities are working to meet a goal of one-third renewables by 2020.\n\nIn a lot of ways, this should be easy for California. The price of solar power has plunged\u2014for utility scale solar, it can be cheaper to build and operate a plant (given existing incentives) than it is to simply supply fuel to a natural gas plant. Plus, countries like Spain and Germany (which also has a goal of 50 percent by 2030) have already done extensive solar rollouts and can provide valuable lessons.\n\nFurther Reading Utility-scale solar costs down by half in last five years alone \"PV compares favorably to just the fuel costs of natural gas-fired generation.\"\n\nAnd on top of that, California is nearly ideal solar territory. Extensive deserts and scrubland see mostly cloudless days and little of the dust that plagues deserts in other parts of the world. These regions are generally close to major urban areas and existing transmission infrastructure, and you'd expect that California would have a relatively smooth time ramping up its renewable power.\n\nBut there are challenges inherent in the structures we use to handle and pay for electricity. Going half renewable doesn't just strain the grid as a distribution method; it challenges the economic assumptions on which we've built our electric grid. To have a grid where half the power is supplied by intermittent renewable sources, we'll have to completely rethink how we manage the electric grid.\n\nSo in many ways, solar power is likely to be a truly disruptive technology. And it's likely to cause some destruction in the process of disruption.\n\nWhat do we need from solar?\n\nRemarkably little, as it turns out. Most classes of photovoltaic power\u2014thin film, silicon, etc.\u2014are seeing incremental improvements, and that's likely to continue. But we're unlikely to see any radical leaps in these areas. There are also a number of areas in active research, primarily involving concentrating solar power\u2014technologies that focus sunlight on highly efficient (but highly expensive) photovoltaic devices. So far, none of these technologies have gotten to the point where they're close to competitive with traditional tech like silicon.\n\nWe talked to two people who focus on solar energy at the Department of Energy: Landis Kannberg of the Pacific Northwest National Lab and Paul Basore, a Principal Engineer at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Neither of them knew of any technologies in the works that were likely to reduce the costs of installation or support hardware.\n\nSilicon photovoltaics have gotten so cheap, in fact, that the panels themselves are only a small part of the total expense of installing a system. This is the one thing that could make concentrating solar economically viable. As installation and permitting costs grow to dominate the price of photovoltaics, it starts to become more economical to harvest more energy from each panel\u2014precisely what concentrating solar allows. However, it's not certain that this trend will ever intersect the price trend of concentrating solar.\n\nPlus there's a non-technological solution to the cost of installation: simplifying the permitting process. \"You only have to look to Europe to see that it could be a lot better than it is now in the US,\" Basore told Ars. \"In Italy, modules there are less than half the cost. It's gotten to the point where modules are maybe a third of the cost in Europe. In the US, we approach that at utility scale. But anything smaller than utility scale in the US, the modules become an almost negligible part of the total cost.\"\n\nOther areas where policy could help out is a consistent approach to tax credits. \"In the US at least, the changing policies relative to tax credits has a whipsaw effect on demand,\" Kannberg told Ars. That, in turn, has sent mixed messages to hardware manufacturers. But the market has now grown to the point where the specific policy in place in the US doesn't have as much of an effect on global manufacturing. \"The prices are dropping or have dropped to where, at least from an international standpoint, it's a pretty compelling technology now, and I suspect that manufacturing capacity may soon become an issue.\"\n\nAssuming manufacturing continues to ramp up, supplying California with the hardware it needs shouldn't be a problem. And if the US can get its policy house in order, getting that hardware to homes should be manageable as well.\n\nWhat does a 50 percent renewable grid look like?\n\nWe don't have to imagine what California's 50 percent renewable grid will look like. Since their businesses depend on it, a number of California utilities asked a group of analysts to look into it. The organization they hired modeled a variety of different potential scenarios, including some with a diverse portfolio of renewable sources and some relying heavily on rooftop or utility-scale solar.\n\nThe biggest challenge with going to half renewables is overgeneration. The state receives power from a number of sources that simply can't be shut down\u2014combined heat and power systems and nuclear plants, for example. Layered on top of that are renewable sources like solar that generate power whether you want them to or not. This isn't a problem with California's 2020 goals (33 percent renewables) even on sunny days in the spring. But by the time the grid reaches 40 percent renewables, there could be as much as five GigaWatts of overproduction on a sunny afternoon. At half renewables, there's a staggering 20GW of overproduction.\n\nBy 5pm, however, the overproduction is gone. As people get home from work and start the largest demand peak of the day, stored electricity and out-of-state imports have to be called into play to meet it.\n\nThe analysis found a variety of ways to limit the impact of this overproduction. The simplest is storage. California has targeted adding 1.3GW of storage to its grid within the decade, and it currently has about three Gigawatts of pumped hydro, the most economic form of storage. But given the recent drought, it's not clear whether all of that will be available at any moment. In any case, it's not going to be sufficient to absorb all of the overproduction, even assuming the storage was empty to start the day.\n\nOther options include diversifying the mix of renewables used to reach the 50 percent goal. A scenario that supplemented the photovoltaics with other sources\u2014such as biomass, wind, geothermal, and solar thermal power\u2014cut the overproduction by roughly half. Further efforts to integrate California's grid to those of surrounding states would also allow it to export some of the excess. All of these things would help to varying degrees, although it's still likely that some electricity would have to be discarded.\n\nAll of it comes at a cost. The 33 percent renewable grid isn't expected to add significantly to the rates California consumers would pay; they'd go up, but largely from work that would have to be done anyway. By going to 50 percent, however, the report estimates the state's rate payers will be on the hook for an increase of anywhere between nine and 23 percent."}
{"61": "\"We're going to do some laps, but this isn't a track car. If I hear anyone complaining about brake fade or lap times I'm not going to be happy.\" So went the pep talk from Audi leading up to our time with the company's new TT. And while we got several laps\u2014at the Circuit of the Americas no less, before the Lone Star Le Mans races\u2014there are few things we'd rather do with a new car than get to know it on a world-class circuit. The prospect of our first track time this year only came in second on our list of \"reasons we want to drive the new Audi TT.\" Rather, we were really excited to try out the car's UI, which the company calls \"Virtual Cockpit.\"\n\nReplacing all a car's dials and gauges with a single TFT screen isn't new, but the TT is the first car we've driven to start really pushing the idea. It works in conjunction with Audi's MMI infotainment system\u2014which is really quite good now\u2014letting you do cool things like displaying Google Maps full-screen with overlays for important info from the car. Ambitious UI experiments don't always succeed, but after several hundred miles the TT's clever dash thoroughly impressed us. Oh, and the rest of the car wasn't too bad either. Like the nice man from Audi said, it's not a track car. Style takes priority over speed, but that's no bad thing if done properly.\n\nLooking good has always been the TT's reason for being. It first appeared in 1995 as a concept car, wowing the crowds at that year's Frankfurt auto show. Three years later the Mk 1 TT went into production, keeping almost all of the concept's good looks. Underneath it made good use of Volkswagen Group's parts bin, something that's always left the car (and the subsequent Mk 2) with accusations of being a \"Golf in drag.\" These days those kinds of insults are somewhat meaningless. Sure, both TT and Golf use VW's Modularer Querbaukasten (MQB) platform, but so do eight other cars; that's the entire point of developing MQB. This chassis is a mix of steel for the bits that undergo the most stress and extruded aluminum. The body panels are also mostly aluminum, too, which has helped make the third generation TT 110 lbs (50kg) lighter than the outgoing car.\n\nElle Cayabyab Gitlin The third-generation TT adds some R8-inspired menace to the classic TT shape. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The third-generation TT adds some R8-inspired menace to the classic TT shape. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The iconic aluminum fuel filler door is present and correct. You just push it down and it springs open, and there's no filler cap underneath to worry about. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin This will be slightly subjective, but we adore the styling of the interior. Everything you touch feels well-made, whether it's plastic or machined aluminum. Audi Vents with integrated controls for the air conditioning. Highly reminiscent of a Nest thermostat in our opinion. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin On track at the Circuit of the Americas. The cockpit ergonomics are good, although there are reports that very tall or wide drivers might not love it.\n\nThe exterior styling is an evolution of the first TT's design, now featuring more hard angles. It's literally an edgy interpretation of the classic TT, although there are a few R8 styling cues here and there as well. Signature TT design touches are present and correct: the aluminum fuel filler door, the double-bubble silhouette, the large clamshell hood, and fastback rear hatch. The original TT did without a spoiler at first, requiring a recall to fit one (following costly lawsuits) after early owners found that aerodynamic shape generated lift over the rear at speed. Here, there's a retractable spoiler that rises at speed, which does the car's appearance many favors. Overall, it is, to our eyes, an extremely attractive car to look at; not a bad thing in this market segment.\n\nInside, things are even better. We've said this before, so at the risk of sounding like a stuck record, there really is no volume car maker better at interiors than Audi right now. Again, this was evident back with the original TT and its famous baseball glove seats. You sit low in the car, hugged well by the leather seats (with a frightening amount of electric adjustment). Large turbine-shaped air vents stud the dashboard. Each has a small LCD display at its center, a bit like a Nest thermostat. There are a few toggle switches on the dash (for changing the driving mode, turning on the hazard lights, and turning off the parking sensors and traction control), but almost everything else is handled either with the MMI jogwheel or its mirrored controls on the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nSpecs at a glance: 2016 Audi TT Coupe Body type 2-door coupe Layout Front engine, all wheel drive Powerplant 2L turbocharged direct injection inline 4. Transmission Six-speed S-Tronic Dual Clutch Automatic Horsepower 220 bhp @ 4,500-6,200 rpm Torque 258 lb-ft @ 1,600-4,400 rpm Steering Variable ratio electromechanical power steering Suspension Weight-saving MacPherson strut front suspension, four-link rear suspension.

The metal finish is used as a highlight to good effect throughout the interior. It's a dark cabin but doesn't feel gloomy. There's decent room for both driver and front seat passenger, but the rear seats are for occasional use only. That's not to suggest it isn't a practical car; it's merely a practical car for two. The trunk has lots of room even with the back seats up, and folded down one ought to be able to fit bicycles or other large unwieldy things in the back.\n\nUp front is a 2L TSFI engine, which means gasoline, a turbocharger, and direct injection. Power and torque\u2014220hp (162kW) and 258lb-ft (350nM)\u2014gets sent to all four wheels via a six-speed dual clutch gearbox. In fact, the TT is constantly reading the coefficient of traction at all four wheels (Audi tells us it does this 150 times every 10 milliseconds) as well as the steering angle and yaw rate, altering the torque sent front-to-rear via an electronically controlled (Haldex) clutch between the front wheels via light applications of the brake (this is also how the ESC system works). It will even send all of the available power to the front or rear wheels should conditions demand.\n\nYou can choose between different driving modes with a toggle switch on the dash; Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, and Individual. Dynamic sharpens the throttle response, weights up the steering, stiffens the suspension, and sends the majority of the power to the rear wheels. You also get some quiet (but lovely) pops and parps from the exhaust when shifting up through the gears in Dynamic, even if the engine is otherwise rather aurally anonymous. Comfort takes things the other way as well as telling the gearbox to freewheel when you're not on the accelerator for better fuel efficiency. Individual\u2014as you might guess\u2014lets you pick and choose different settings for each of these, so you can have a soft comfy ride but sportier engine noise and rearward-biased power delivery, for example.\n\nOverall, performance is adequate. If you're looking for a coupe to take to the track or go canyon carving, Porsche's Cayman might be a better choice. Zero to 60mph takes about 5.5 seconds, and the car tops out at 130mph (209km/h). But that's not to say the TT is dull to drive. The dual clutch gearbox (S-tronic in Audispeak) feels a little slow to kick down in automatic, so you'll want to use the paddles on the steering wheel when making progress. Handling is reminiscent of a Golf GTI, which is no bad thing. Audi was kind enough to arrange for some hot laps at the Circuit of the Americas (COTA to its friends) the morning of the big races, which gave us a chance to push the car in a way we wouldn't on public roads.\n\nElle Cayabyab Gitlin The offer of a few hot laps of a current F1 circuit are usually enough reason to pay for the airfare, and we thoroughly enjoyed driving the TT at COTA. But that was still only the second coolest thing about the TT.

If you look closely, you'll see we're on one of the circuit roads, heading to the track for our laps. Audi Drive Select allows you to tweak the settings for all these different systems. The way you can tune and adjust cars on the fly thanks to electronics is one of our favorite things about modern cars.

Audi A diagram showing how the car vectors torque between front and rear axles, and from side to side. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The aftermath of our four hot laps. There was a huge amount of rubber pickup from the track, and much of it was still there two days and 250 miles later. We apologize to whoever got the job of cleaning the tires.\n\nCOTA has a marvelous complex of decreasing radius corners, which the TT handled capably, the same going for the track's wonderful sweeping turn 19. We also got near the car's top speed on the long back straight. Unfortunately, by the third lap the TT's tires had picked up enormous quantities of rubber from the track, a consequence of so many different races (and tire compounds) that weekend. Large chunks of tire pickup were being flung at us from the TT in front, and things started to get very understeery. Discretion being the better part of valor, we backed off and cruised around for the remainder of our hot lap session before handing the track over to a parade of more than 100 Porsches.\n\nThat tire pickup stayed with the car for the rest of our weekend, making the drive back to Dallas somewhat less relaxing than it could have been, thanks to the vibration from having not-completely round wheels. (Ah, the joys of press fleet cars; some other poor bugger gets the job of cleaning them afterward. We should note that at Ars, we do our very best not to abuse press cars and always try to give them back with at least half a tank of gas.)\n\nArtificial washboard effect aside, the TT was extremely effective on the freeways of Texas. The Lone Star state has an admirable approach to highway speed limits, and the TT ate the miles from Austin to Dallas. Active lane assist is available, but sadly there's no adaptive cruise control. This is a real pity; the one-two combination of these systems takes much of the fatigue out of long road trips in so-equipped cars.\n\nListing image by Elle Cayabyab Gitlin"}

{"63": "Nintendo has won a court ruling against PC Box, an Italian company that distributed devices to circumvent the technical protection measures (TPM) of the Wii U and DS, allowing for the use of homebrew software. The ruling states that circumvention devices like the game copiers and modchip devices PC Box distributed are in fact primarily used to play pirated games, thus breaking European copyright law.\n\nThe ruling marks a dramatic turnaround in the case against Milan-based PC Box, which won an early victory from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) back in 2014. At the time, the First Instance Tribunal of Milan sought clarification from the CJEU on the extent of the legal protection given to TPMs under the Information Society Directive. Specifically, it asked whether national courts should take into account legitimate uses for circumvention devices\u2014playback of audio and video files, for example\u2014and if protection measures overruled that usage.\n\nFurther Reading Exploit allows 3DS to run arbitrary Game Boy ROMs Hack shows Virtual Console emulator can work with all legacy software.\n\nThe CJEU's preliminary ruling (PDF) seemed to rule in favour of PC Box. It noted that, while the technological protection measures attached to copyrighted works can be rightfully implemented in software (games) and hardware (the console), that protection must be proportional and not prohibit activities which have a \"commercially significant purpose\" or use other than to circumvent copy protection. Essentially, PC Box's tech wasn't unlawful, because because the content it enabled wasn't itself unlawful.\n\nHowever, the CJEU's ruling was merely advisory and the final interpretation of the rules and judgement were ultimately determined by the Tribunal of Milan. Aside from ruling that PC Box's circumvention devices were being used to primarily play pirated games, thus making them unlawful, it also noted that Nintendo\u2019s security measures were proportionate and protected under Italian copyright law.\n\n\"Nintendo is pleased that this ruling is consistent with a long line of judicial precedents established at national courts in a number of Member States including Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain and the UK,\" Nintendo said in a statement. \"It is unlawful to import and sell circumvention devices under Italian law and sellers could face criminal sentences and fines as well as hefty damages. Nintendo's advice to its fans is 'don't fund piracy by purchasing these devices and stay out of the business of selling them.\"\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK"}
{"64": "A lawsuit in which activists accused the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) of seeking SOPA-like powers has ended without resolving much of anything.\n\nWhoever was behind the accused piracy website MovieTube seems to have disappeared. MovieTube didn't respond to the complaint, and it blew off a scheduled August 18 hearing. Yesterday, US District Judge Paul Crotty entered a default judgment (PDF) and injunction handing over the MovieTube site to the MPAA. Crotty also ordered the site owners, if they're ever found, to pay a $10.5 million penalty for willful copyright infringement (or $75,000 per infringed work).\n\nMovieTube was shuttered shortly after the complaint (PDF) was filed, which resulted in the MPAA dropping its request for a controversial preliminary injunction. MPAA lawyers asked for a broad order that would have affected not just MovieTube but loads of intermediary service providers.\n\nFurther Reading Memo to MPAA: Congress didn\u2019t pass SOPA Studios' suit demands \"entire Internet\" block, filtering infringing sites, EFF says.

The two-bit piracy site, which openly stated on one of its Facebook pages that it did \"not need to respect US laws,\" isn't going to end up paying millions to the MPAA or anyone else. The MPAA believes current law gives it the right to keep asking for a \"back door\" to SOPA-like remedies, but the opposition from Internet companies will be vigorous.\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica"}

Andrew Cunningham The keyboard cover and Wacom stylus. The layout and travel are basically identical to HP's recent EliteBooks, which is to say it feels pretty good.

USB Type-C is used for charging, which will become more and more handy as USB Type-C becomes more common. Andrew Cunningham There are two separate keyboard accessories. The thicker one (top) includes NFC and a smart card reader. Both have the same keyboard and trackpad, however. HP The kickstand opens up to 150 degrees, but is stable at any angle. HP A press render of the kickstand. HP A press render of the Wacom-made pen accessory, which is functionally similar to what Microsoft is offering with the Surface. HP The various accessories HP is offering with the tablet.\n\nAs Microsoft's Surface designs have improved and become more successful, clones of the same general idea from the PC OEMs have become more and more common (the same thing happened with the Lenovo Yoga design after Windows 8 came out). Lenovo has the Miix 700, Dell has its new XPS 12, and HP recently debuted the Spectre x2. Most of those PCs straddle the line between tablet and laptop by combining a big touch-capable slab of a tablet with the Surface's kickstand-plus-keyboard-cover idea.\n\nYesterday, we got a chance to look at another iteration of the idea from HP, dubbed the Elite x2. If you're familiar with HP's naming conventions, you'll know that its \"Elite\" products are typically high-end business computers that are sleek and well-designed enough to be attractive to home users, and that's what the Elite x2 is trying to do. It's a version of the Surface's design that makes concessions to businesses that like to repair and upgrade systems on-site\u2014you can actually remove the screws hiding underneath its kickstand and pull the screen off with a suction cup, exposing the battery, SSD, motherboard, and the Wi-Fi and cellular cards for easy repair and replacement (as best as we can tell, the RAM is still soldered to the motherboard). The Surface Pro has never been an easy machine to open and work on, so these are all nice options to have.\n\nThe construction of the tablet itself is a little on the boxy side but definitely high-end. It's made primarily of aluminum, with the exception of the glass that covers the display and a strip on the back where the camera and its LED flash are embedded. The kickstand is also aluminum, but it's just a thin piece of metal rather than a big aluminum slab like the Surface kickstand. HP tells us that it's made out of 7000-series aluminum (as opposed to the lighter 6000-series aluminum used for the rest of the chassis), which should help keep it sturdy, and it leaves more room in the body of the tablet to fit the battery and other components. The kickstand is stable regardless of the angle you use, and bends back up to 150 degrees, which is useful when you're drawing on it with the pen.\n\nIn addition to looking a bit boxier than the Surface Pro 4, the Elite x2 is a bit taller, wider, and heavier than Microsoft's tablet. HP's is about 300mm (11.8 inches) long and 214mm (8.4 inches) tall, compared to 292 and 201.3mm for the Surface. The Elite also weighs 840g (1.85 pounds), compared to 766g (1.69 pounds) for the lightest Surface.\n\nThe sides of the Elite x2 are crammed full of ports, buttons, and slots. On the left side you've got a power button, volume rocker, SIM tray, and lock slot. On the right, there's a headphone jack, one full-size USB 3.0 port, a microSD card tray, and a Thunderbolt 3 port that also charges the tablet. Thunderbolt 3 is fully compatible with USB Type-C, and Intel's Thunderbolt controller also provides full 10Gbps USB 3.1 gen 2 speeds, something you can't get from vanilla Type-C ports. HP provides Thunderbolt and USB Type-C docking stations, as well as a wireless 802.11ad docking station that automatically docks the tablet when it's in range (as long as you have the required wireless card).\n\nLike the Surface, the Elite x2 is best when paired with its (included) pen and (optional) keyboard covers. The Wacom digitizer and pen seem functionally similar to what you get with the N-Trig solution in the Surface Pro 4\u2014it's got two buttons on the side and one button on the top that's used for launching OneNote, and it supports 2,048 levels of pressure. I'm not an artist, but scribbling things in OneNote or marking up a page in Microsoft Edge was fast and accurate, and felt more or less the same as doing the same tasks on a Surface.\n\nThe keyboard covers are based on the keyboard layout already used in EliteBooks like the 1020 we reviewed late last year, which means it has a nice layout and backlight, good travel, and a fairly large trackpad. The palmrest is aluminum rather than fabric, which makes it feel more laptop-y, and the keyboard folds up against the screen like it does in the Surface Pro 3 and 4 designs to make the whole apparatus more stable on your lap. The standard version of the keyboard is 5.4mm thick and weighs 395g, and an \"Advanced\" version of the keyboard with integrated NFC and a smart card reader is 8.4mm thick and weighs 470g.\n\nThe one place where the Elite x2 definitely falls short of the Surface Pro 4 is in the spec department. The 12-inch screen is 1080p, making it both smaller and lower-resolution than the Surface's display. It only includes Skylake Core m3, m5, and m7 processors, which means all configurations are fanless but that they'll also have lower CPU and GPU performance than the full-fledged Core i5 and i7 versions of the Surface. And there's no option for 16GB of RAM, for those who want or need it. 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.2, and an LTE option courtesy of Qualcomm are all more-or-less in line with what the Surface offers, and HP offers either SATA, encrypted SATA, or PCI Express SSDs in the M.2 form factor (these can be upgraded after purchase if you'd like). An embedded fingerprint reader on the back is compatible with Windows Hello, but the front-facing webcam doesn't appear to be.\n\nThe Elite x2 will start shipping in early January and starts at $899. We've asked HP about the exact specs of that configuration and how much the keyboard accessories will cost, and will update this post when we have those details.\n\nListing image by HP"}
{"66": "Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable, have a high energy storage capacity, and exhibit minimal loss of charge when not in use. In our day-to-day lives, we enjoy the benefits of this technology. We have e-readers that can last on battery power for weeks at a time and cell phones that do not need to be charged daily.\n\nYet lithium-ion battery adoption has remained constrained due to concerns over safety, cost, and environmental impact. Recently, an interdisciplinary team of scientists and engineers tackled one of these issues by developing a significantly safer lithium-ion battery.\n\nPast safety concerns have focused on the electrolytes used in these batteries, which help transfer charge between the electrodes. These electrolytes are often highly flammable, reactive with other battery components (like the electrodes), and depend on highly toxic materials (lithium salts) to shuttle the charges. These safety concerns impose costly processing steps during fabrication of the batteries and limit their range of applications.\n\nAn electrochemical stability window\n\nIn a study recently published in Science, scientists demonstrated a safe, aqueous electrolyte. In the past, use of aqueous electrolytes has been limited because they exhibit a narrow electrochemical stability window\u2014the voltage range between which the battery's materials neither lose electrons (oxidation) nor gain them (reduction). As a consequence of this narrow electrochemical stability window, deterioration of the electrode structure often occurs due to hydrogen evolution at the anode.\n\nWhen nonaqueous electrolyte systems are used, the electrodes (both cathode and anode) are usually functional over a much larger range. This results from the formation of a layer of solid electrolyte on the surface of the electrode, which constitutes a barrier that allows movement of ions and prevents movement of electrons. The interphase is formed when some of the electrolyte decomposes during initial charging.\n\nThis interface doesn't form in aqueous systems, because decomposition of water results in the formation of H 2 , O 2 , or OH-, none of which are deposited at the electrode surface. The lack of a solid electrolyte interface limits aqueous lithium ion (Li+) batteries to low voltage (<1.5 V) and low energy density (70 Wh/kg).\n\nBut the new work describes a way to manipulate electrolyte decomposition in aqueous electrolytes to form a solid-electrolyte interface.\n\nEstablishing a solid electrolyte interface\n\nIn order to achieve this, the scientists needed to find a lithium salt that was highly soluble and chemically stable in water. On top of that, they needed a salt that was capable of accepting electrons at a specific potential, causing a reaction that produced a solid product that was insoluble in aqueous media. Few lithium salts meet these requirements, but the researchers found one\u2014lithium bis(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI)\u2014worth exploring.\n\nUsing LiTFSI, the researchers created a highly concentrated solution (molality > 20), meaning the Li+ ions actually outnumber the water molecules. The remarkably high number of ions in this \u201cwater-in-salt\u201d solution results in unusual behaviors. In fact, interactions between the Li+ ions become more common than the typical water-ion interactions found in salt solutions.\n\nDue to these ion-ion interactions, the Li+ ions are able to form a dense interphase surrounding the electrode (anode) where they gain electrons. Because of this interface, the electrochemical stability window is increased to ~3.0 V.\n\nThermal analysis of the 20-mole and 21-mole solutions from room temperature down to -90\u00b0 C revealed that the solutions were still \u201ctrue\u201d liquids\u2014exhibiting no order. At room temperature, the conductivity of a 21 mole solution is comparable to nonaqueous electrolytes used in commercial Li-ion batteries. The researchers also found that as the LiTFSI concentration increased, the total electrochemical stability window expanded.\n\nOverall, they found that high concentrations of LiTFSI in water reduces water activity, modulates redox potentials, and suppresses the decomposition of water through formation of a solid-electrolyte interface.\n\nUnderstanding the solid-electrolyte interface\n\nUsing a variety of analytical techniques, the team demonstrated the existence of an interphase in the aqueous electrolytes. This analysis also allowed the team to develop an understanding of the Li+ sheath and its role in the interphasial chemistry.\n\nIn a normal, dilute solution (<5 mole), water is abundant and is able to form a normal sheath around both Li+ and TFSI-, which are surrounded by four water molecules. If you increase the salt concentration, we eventually get to a point (>10 mole solution) where there is not enough water to create this sheath.\n\nIn a 21-mole solution, you push the salt concentration far past this point, and the solution exists in a state where there are only 2.6 water molecules per each Li+. In this state, the water is not able to effectively neutralize the electrostatic field created by the positive charge on the lithium ion. The excess positive charge then attracts the negatively charged TFSI- ion. TFSI- then enters the sheath, leading to a Li+TFSI- interaction. This forms on the anode, where TFSI- is reduced, releasing fluorine that forms LiF.\n\nFormation of solid-electrolyte interface at the anode allows the voltage to be decoupled from the cycling stability. Additionally, the shortage of free water molecules decreases electrochemical activity, which benefits the stability limits of both electrodes.\n\nThe authors constructed a full Li-ion cell with electrodes composed of LiMn 2 O 4 (cathode) and Mo 6 S 8 (anode). These full cells exhibited excellent stability, high capacity retention, and almost 100 percent coulombic efficiency.\n\nScience, 2015. DOI: 10.1126/science.aab1595 (About DOIs)."}

Using a video camera, a frame grabbing card, and a Motorola 68000 series-based computer running VME, they created a networked sensor that could show the current state of the pot. First configured as an X-Windows application, the Trojan Coffee Pot server was converted to HTTP in 1993, becoming one of the early stars of the Internet. It was soon joined by other networked sensors, including a number of hot tubs.\n\nToday, millions of devices expose what they see, hear, and otherwise sense to the Internet. And thanks to cheap embedded systems, they don't need an old VME or Windows box to do it. Billions of other devices that defy the usual definition of \"computer\" are communicating over networks, almost entirely with other machines. These \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) devices send telemetry to and receive instructions from software both nearby and on far-flung servers. Software and sensors are controlling more of what once was done by humans, often more efficiently, conveniently, and cheaply.\n\nThis practice is changing how we interact with the physical world. We talk to our televisions and they listen, thanks to embedded sensors and voice processing chips that can tap into the cloud for corrections. We drive down the road and sensors gather data from our cell phones to measure the flow of traffic. Our cars have mobile apps to unlock them. Health devices send data back to doctors, and wristwatches let us send our pulse to someone else. The digital has become physical.\n\nIt has been only eight years since the smartphone emerged, introducing the new age of always-on mobile connectivity, and networked devices now already outnumber the people on the planet. By some estimates, within the next five years, the number of devices connected to the Internet will outnumber the people on the planet by over seven to one\u201450 billion machines, ranging from networked sensors to industrial robots.\n\nInexpensive computing power, cheap or free connectivity, and the relative ease with which new software and chips are making connecting will make it possible for governments, companies, and even individuals to collect detailed data from IoT devices and automate them in some way. It will be the things' Internet; we'll just be living in it.\n\nBut given the state of IoT today, that might be a bumpy tenancy if certain issues aren't ironed out now. Security, privacy, and reliability concerns are the main barriers to a sudden arrival of some singularity where we all live as happy cogs in an IoT machine world. So how will the human social order take to a world of persistent networked everything?\n\nPlugging into the spew\n\nAn airplane being assembled at an Airbus facility. The company is developing \"smart tools\" that use local and network intelligence as part of its \"factory of the future\" initiative. An airplane being assembled at an Airbus facility.

A prototype of GrowBox, an IoT hydroponic system that uses sensors to optimize growth of... tomatoes. The US Army has developed networked sensors in helmets to measure concussive forces soldiers are exposed to in an effort to help protect them from brain injuries.\n\nThe promise of IoT is \"smart\" everything. Nest's Internet-connected Learning thermostat, Nest Cam surveillance camera, and Protect networked smoke alarm promise a more energy-efficient, safer home. IoT technology is a key part of the pitch for \"smart cities,\" \"smart buildings,\" \"smart factories,\" and just about every other \"smart\" proposal from sensor manufacturers, networking companies, and big technology consultancies. Seemingly everyone is looking for a piece of the biggest potential collection of integration projects ever. Sometimes the \"smart\" is relatively close to the sensor itself, but it often relies on a remote cloud service or data center to process the information and control actions.\n\nOn the consumer side, while devices like Nest's get much of the attention, wearable IoT devices are just starting to take off\u2014despite the relatively low impact so far of high-profile efforts like the Apple Watch. \"The Apple Watch may be on a slower liftoff cycle than other recent Apple hardware launches, but it has a complex number of use cases which are finding their home, purpose, and meaning,\" said Mark Curtis, the chief client officer at Fjord, Accenture's design consultancy. Within the next two to three years, he predicted, wrist-based devices will lose the need to be tethered to a smartphone. \"At the same time, interactions between wearables and nearables (e.g., beacons, Amazon Echo, connected cars) will grow.\"\n\nThe health field is the most immediate fit for wearables, because they can gather data that has a benefit without conscious human action. \"A good example is our Fjord Fido diabetes platform,\" Curtis said. \"It requires complex linking between devices and data but would not have been possible without a smartwatch.\"\n\nGovernments are especially interested in the analytical powers of IoT-collected data for all sorts of reasons, from tuning services at the most basic levels to understanding how to respond in an emergency\u2014as well as collecting revenue. Traffic lights and even pedestrian crossing buttons could be used as networked sensors, said Michael Daly, chief technology officer for Raytheon Cybersecurity and Special Missions. \"You could see how many times is this being used and how long people are waiting to cross, then adjust traffic flow accordingly,\" he said.\n\nIndustry is equally interested in the data that can be tapped into by IoT, and more companies are examining the benefits of using the embedded intelligence and network connectivity of IoT devices to improve their own systems and products. In most of these applications, National Instruments Executive Vice President Eric Starkloff told Ars, companies are most interested in instrumenting their operations, \"looking for events that are a warning of impending failure\" in systems or squeezing additional efficiency out of their operations. So far, only a small fraction of industrial systems have network-based telemetry gathering, and Starkloff said that the greatest opportunities for growth over the next five years are in \"brown field\" applications. These are instances of simply upgrading or enhancing existing hardware in factories, refineries, office buildings and other physical plants with IoT goodness.\n\nManufacturing companies have been among the earliest adopters of IoT. General Electric has pushed forward its own massive internal investment in IoT technology to collect analytic data from everything from gas turbine engines to locomotives. IoT is also part of the \"factory of the future\" concept embraced by aircraft manufacturer Airbus, where National Instruments is helping the company put \"smart IoT technologies into their smart tooling and robotics systems that work alongside human operators,\" according to Starkloff.\n\nAirbus' IoT interest is as much about ensuring the precision of the company's manufacturing as it is about sensing potential problems. \"Today they put planes together mostly manually,\" Starkloff said. \"They want to move to the point where tools are intelligent\u2014where a tool knows whether a rivet was put in correctly.\" To do that, the analytics tracking system performance \"has to be close, not up in cloud,\" he explained. \"They need devices communicating locally\u2014smart tooling connected to smart wearables, such as glasses with a heads-up display.\"\n\nIn a way, Airbus' vision mirrors one that Boeing attempted in the 1990s with augmented reality (one the company has continued to invest in ever since). It's also similar to some of the methods of tying IoT technology to augmented reality visualization we saw at GE Software earlier this year, where technicians could be directed to equipment needing service in a manufacturing environment and stepped through the process with visual cues. But Airbus' setup also includes using IoT technology to communicate between human operated tools and robotic systems, passing data over a local network to allow machines and humans to work collaboratively.\n\nThe Department of Defense has similar designs on IoT, though the systems that the DOD wants to enhance are often soldiers themselves. Embedded and wearable systems are turning soldiers into nodes on the DOD network, both to enhance their battlefield performance and to track their well-being. Aside from the work on autonomous drones and other sensors, the Army has developed networked helmet sensors that can help detect the severity of concussive blows (a bit of tech that the NFL has moved to adopt as well). The military, through a number of DARPA projects and other labs, continues to develop wearable technologies that will allow soldiers to interact with other systems.\n\nAt a recent conference sponsored by the Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC), scientists discussed the possibility of \"implanted\" sensors that could communicate what a soldier was doing without the soldier having to consciously communicate it. Thomas F. Greco, director of intelligence at TRADOC, said that IoT technology coupled with wearable sensors could result in a \"precision of knowing,\" reducing ambiguity on the battlefield and allowing commanders to have absolute knowledge of what troops were doing. But he also said that having that kind of data could affect the order and discipline of soldiers. \"Ambiguity is a kind of lubricant in personal relationships,\" he said, wondering how that would change \"when you have total knowledge and accountability.\""}
{"68": "Ron Amadeo The OnePlus X. Ron Amadeo The OnePlus X. The whole back of the X is glass. The 13MP camera is decent for a $249 phone. There are capacitive hardware buttons, but they don't light up and don't have useful labels. There is also an option for on-screen buttons, if you prefer. The phone is wrapped in a flat metal band. One side has this crazy three-position notification mode switch. Along the bottom are speaker holes and a MicroUSB 2.0 port. The other side has a set of very well-made power and volume buttons.\n\nReviewing a device from OnePlus is always a strange proposition. We get the devices at Ars because we're privileged journalists, but most people can't just go out and buy a OnePlus device. The company insists on selling its devices through an \"invite\" system, which makes buying OnePlus devices a huge hassle. You can show up to OnePlus' website cash-in-hand (metaphorically), and you'll be turned away if you don't have a golden ticket.\n\nThe reason is that OnePlus just can't afford to sell a ton of phones at the listed MSRP. The upstart company freely admits it has \"No plan to make any money for two years,\" and along with the limited release strategy, we're guessing it loses money (or, at best, breaks even) on every device it sells. OnePlus' current business strategy is unsustainable, so it feels a little dishonest to compare the company's devices to products from actual functioning businesses trying to make a profit. OnePlus seems to be more focused on generating hype than generating sales.\n\nStill, the business model is not really the consumer's problem, so if you're interested in taking advantage of OnePlus' generosity, let us present to you the \"OnePlus X,\" the company's latest bang-for-your-buck smartphone. The \"X\" takes what is basically a late-2013 or early-2014 flagship and sells it two years later for $249. Imagine a Nexus 5 or Galaxy S5 and you're in the right ballpark. You're getting a 5-inch, 1080p display powered by a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 801 SoC.\n\nDesign and Build quality\n\nSPECS AT A GLANCE: ONEPLUS X SCREEN 1920\u00d71080, 5-inch (441ppi) AMOLED OS Android 5.1.1 Lollipop with OxygenOS skin CPU 2.3GHz Quad-core Snapdragon 801 RAM 3GB GPU Adreno 330 STORAGE 16GB, plus micro SD expansion up to 128GB NETWORKING 2.4GHz 802.11 Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0 PORTS Micro USB, headphone jack CAMERA 13MP f/2.2 rear camera, 8MP f/2.4 selfie camera SIZE 140 \u00d7 69 \u00d7 6.9mm (5.5 \u00d7 2.7 \u00d7 0.27 inches) WEIGHT 138g (4.86 oz) BATTERY 2525mAh NETWORK BANDS GSM: 850, 900, 1800, 1900MHz; WCDMA (EU): bands 1/2/5/8; LTE bands: 1/2/4/5/8/38/40; WCDMA (US): bands 1/3/5/7/8/20; FDD-LTE: bands 1/2/4/5/7/8 OTHER PERKS FM radio, RGB notification LED, hardware notification mode switch PRICE $249 (\u20ac269, \u00a3199) for black Onyx version\n\nIt's the build quality that makes the OnePlus X stand out. The body is a finely crafted glass and metal sandwich that would be right at home on a $600 flagship. The glass front and back make the OnePlus X feel like a high-quality, solid object that's worth way more than the $250 asking price.\n\nThe extra glass panel will make it more fragile than your average smartphone, so this device isn't for people who drop their devices often. The glass back also has a tendency to \"creep\" off of a table, thanks to the perfectly smooth, slippery surface. You might think your table is perfectly flat, but if it isn't, the OnePlus will start slowly sliding away.\n\nA flat, aluminum band wraps around the perimeter of the OnePlus X, and along with the front and back glass, it's very reminiscent of an iPhone 4 or 4S. OnePlus has tried to separate itself by darkening the band to a gunmetal color and engraving tiny ridges into it, but there is no hiding the X's ancestry. The ridges do give the side a very grippy texture, which is great since dropping an all-glass smartphone is probably a bad idea.\n\nThe excellent build quality continues all along the sides of the OnePlus X. The power and volume buttons are also metal and don't have an ounce of wiggle to them. The buttons have firm, clicky mechanisms that feel like they will last a while. Along the bottom of the metal band are milled speaker holes that form a pair of speaker ports, but only one actually has a speaker behind it. The good news is that the single speaker is quite loud and will work just fine for the usual ringtones, notifications, and the occasional YouTube video.\n\nThere are even a few extras on the device. The oddest addition, just like the OnePlus 2, is the notification priority switch on the side of the device. The three-position hardware switch changes Android's do-not-disturb mode between \"No Interruptions,\" \"Priority Interruptions Only,\" and \"All Notifications.\" Unlike the OnePlus 2 implementation, the switch overrides all the other software and hardware buttons on the device. Put it in the \"No Interruptions\" position and there is no way to exit that mode unless you move the switch\u2014volume buttons won't do it.\n\nAlso in the extras department: you get dual SIM cards or a single SIM card and a MicroSD slot. The SIM tray on the OnePlus has a crazy design that lets the second card slot fit either a second nano SIM or an SD card, and somehow the electronics work out internally to let this happen.\n\nThe price comes with some compromises\n\nThere's no getting around it; the OnePlus X looks like a big iPhone 4. There's no getting around it; the OnePlus X looks like a big iPhone 4. Both backs are glass... And the glass sandwich is wrapped in a metal band. We're cheating a bit and switching to an iPhone 5s, but it's obvious where the bottom came from, too. At least the metal bands are different colors.\n\nGetting down to that $250 price point did mean cutting a few corners. The specs line up with a flagship phone from late 2013 or early 2014, but given how little Qualcomm chips have improved in the last year, that's not a huge deal. The biggest deal for many (in the US, at least) will be the lack of LTE bands 12 and 17. Band 12 is T-Mobile's slice of the 700 MHz spectrum, which it plans to quickly expand to, while Band 17 is the primary transport for AT&T's LTE network. Depending on where you are, you might be able to pick up some AT&T LTE, but a big chunk of it will be unavailable to the OnePlus X. OnePlus sells a North American and EU version of the device, but even the NA version lacks these bands.\n\nThe other oddity\u2014which we have to assume is a cost-cutting measure\u2014is in the capacitive navigation buttons. They don't have a backlight. They are unlit all the time, which makes them difficult to see in a lot of lighting conditions. Like the OnePlus 2, the capacitive buttons on the OnePlus X can be customized and flipped around, and since you can't change the symbols on the buttons, OnePlus chose to again go with generic dash symbols.\n\nWe sort of get OnePlus' line of thinking. The buttons aren't usefully labeled, so why bother lighting them up? It's definitely strange to see them in action, though. We have the same complaints here that we had with the OnePlus 2: we really like our buttons to be clearly, accurately labeled, and now we'll add that we also like to see where exactly the touch targets are and have them light up. We could never get used to the odd button labels, and as a result it slowed down our use of the phone. The good news is that if you're like us and can't stand the dark, unlabeled buttons, there's also an option to enable the on-screen button bar with the standard Android navigation layout.\n\nThe OnePlus X also lacks NFC, so there will be no Android Pay shenanigans here. There also isn't USB Type-C\u2014the OnePlus X sticks with the tried-and-true Micro USB 2.0 port. We're not at the point where we're demanding a Type C port on every new phone, it's just surprising given that the OnePlus 2 has a Type-C port.\n\nThe Wi-Fi support won't be what you're used to on a high-end phone, either. The X is missing both 5GHz support and 802.11ac\u2014the fastest Wi-Fi is 2.4GHz 802.11n. Of course, on a person-by-person basis this only matters if you have a high-end router that pumps out the appropriate signals. 2.4GHz 802.11n is perfectly fine for browsing the Internet, provided your airwaves aren't too crowded.\n\nListing image by Ron Amadeo"}

Element14 Adafruit Another shot of the Pi Zero. In the US, they sell breath mints in nice little metal tins that are very useful for storing tobacco or other similar products. This month's MagPi magazine comes with a free Pi Zero.\n\nHave you ever wanted a Raspberry Pi but thought that \u00a316/$25\u2014roughly three packs of cigarettes\u2014was a little exorbitant for a complete computer capable of running Linux? Well, I have good news: the Raspberry Pi Foundation has just released the Pi Zero, a single-board computer that costs just \u00a34/$5.\n\nThe Zero isn't just some add-on module or something like that, either\u2014it's a full-fledged member of the Raspberry Pi family. The Zero is powered by a Broadcom BCM2835 (the same SoC in the Raspberry Pi 1), with a 1GHz ARM11 CPU core. There's 512MB of RAM; a micro SD slot; two micro USB sockets (data and power); and a mini HDMI socket that can output at 1080p60. Perhaps most importantly, though, the Zero has 40 GPIO pins with the same pinout as the Model A+, B+, and 2B. There's also some headers for RCA composite video out.\n\nThe ARM CPU, according to the Foundation, is 40 percent faster than the original Raspberry Pi 1 Models A, A+, B, and B+. The SoC, plus the RAM and the standard GPIO layout, means that the Zero has enough chutzpah to run Raspbian. It should also be fully compatible with most existing Raspberry Pi software and projects.\n\nThe other notable thing about the Zero, as you may have noticed from the photos and video, is that it's tiny. At 65mm long, 30mm wide, and 5mm tall, it's about half the size of a credit card.\n\nThe Zero is available from a bunch of retailers in the UK for \u00a34 (Element14, The Pi Hut, Pimoroni) and $5 in the US (Adafruit). The Foundation says that they've produced \"several tens of thousands\" of the Zero at its factory in Wales, but they still expect demand to outstrip supply \"for the next little while.\" Rather amusingly, most retailers are attempting to bundle the Zero with an HDMI cable that costs as much as the computer itself. The price of copper nowadays, eh?\n\nAnother option, if you live in the UK, is to pick up a print copy of the MagPi magazine\u2014available in shops today for \u00a36\u2014which comes with a free Pi Zero on the front cover."}
{"70": "For better or worse, you know what to expect from stealth in a Bethesda game. In Skyrim you can walk into a room, steal everything from everyone present\u2014including their clothes\u2014and walk out without a single eyebrow being raised. If you wanted to, you could slice off each of their heads one-by-one, crouching in-between each swipe of your sword, and no-one would notice the bloody carnage taking place.\n\nCrouching is everything in Fallout 4 too: if you crouch, you're far less likely to be spotted, and you get an indicator of how alerted to your presence nearby enemies are. Enemies can see you, but they're more sensitive to movement than to what's actually there\u2014meaning that, if you're spotted, standing still often saves you. Enemies can also hear gunfire and head in that direction, while any enemy you shoot but don't kill will investigate where the shot came from. So far, so logical\u2026 from a gameplay point of view at least.\n\nBut the enemies in Fallout 4 are also incredibly stupid, forgetful, and oblivious to their environments. In my game I have a silenced sniper rifle, and I go around shooting things in the head (Gun Nut 2 to attach suppressors to guns, Ninja perk to increase the damage bonus for surprise attacks). The enemies in Fallout 4 simply have no defence against this tactic, because they're made to deal with head-on attacks, and don't notice that their mate's head has just exploded a few metres away. In fact, they happily patrol over it. They might even see you in the flesh, in the act of killing their precious commander, but if you run away and crouch then twenty seconds later it's all forgotten.\n\nWhat makes this stealth system unusual is in how it scales\u2014because, in a mechanical sense, it can't. In a stealth game like Metal Gear Solid V you acquire better gadgets and outfits that open up new ways to attack. In Fallout 4 you crouch and use weapons in exactly the same way from start to finish. Bethesda empowers the player, not by adding more options, but by abandoning any pretence that Fallout 4 is based on a physical world.\n\nThat's odd given the game's world is built on the illusion of realism. There are countless lines of NPC dialogue to be heard, choices to be made, and endless spontaneous engagements across the wasteland, all designed to create a living, breathing world. Sure, Fallout 4 isn't wholly realistic, but it's a game we're expected to take seriously. And yet, as you level up the stealth system, it becomes more abstracted from what is being visually represented. Enemies become blind to your presence, walking right by you as you're crouched out in the open. As the game progresses, enemies become to resemble dumb AI rather than living creatures\u2014crude sets of rules to be easily understood and toyed with.\n\nA method in the madness?\n\nIt's all too easy to point out tensions in AAA game design\u2014such as every enemy in the game getting progressively blinder\u2014without appreciating that those who made the game are likely well aware of them. The way Fallout 4's stealth operates may seem like madness at times, but there's also a method to it.\n\nStealth ability is improved by choosing the right perks, among which is Stealth itself. At each level it applies a percentage decrease to your chances of being spotted, alongside other buffs. At level 4 you don't even need to crouch anymore. The effect is that enemies mostly stop spotting you\u2014and even when they do, you have the capacity to escape Houdini-like from almost any situation simply by crouching. Add to this the various buffs you can apply to a sneak attack, and most enemies will go down in one shot while their friends look on like nothing's wrong. By the end of the stealth path you can basically walk amongst the masses, casually eviscerating whomever takes your fancy, and no-one bats an eyelid.\n\nThis is so bad it's brilliant. It makes absolutely no sense that Fallout 4's enemies react in the way they do\u2014 but at the same time it's enormous fun to use as a player. This isn't merely about finishing quests or killing things, but the experience of being able to get close to enemy groups and mess with them, observe what they do, and try out lunatic strategies.\n\nEffectively, this makes stealth a kind of developer-sanctioned god mode\u2014something so deliberately overpowered that it wasn't reworked or removed because it's just so much fun. I focused on silenced guns for stealth in my play through, but then I saw this GIF posted by Reddit user CyborgWalrus, which shows a stealth melee build with the \"Blitz\" perk that lets you teleport directly to enemies in VATs\u2014I've never looked at my sniper rifle in quite the same way since.\n\nBut this enormous leap in power is also a huge fracture in the system itself: a low-level stealth character is terrible, simply because the various passive bonuses aren't active, whereas the high-level character is incredible.\n\nThere are other problems with stealth in Fallout 4's world. The overheard dialogue has a few gems, but is mostly generic filler. There's the fact that the stealth systems are analogue\u2014so your movement speed and sound are always crucial\u2014but the on-screen feedback is rudimentary. At lower levels it's annoying how improved the enemies' senses become during a [CAUTION] phase, although that could be taken as another videogame-y touch. And though it's not a fair comparison, MGSV's guards are more interesting to observe than those in Fallout 4, which matters enormously when you spend hours scoping them out.\n\nIt's also not a fair comparison because, while MGSV offers a much more satisfying stealth experience, it has the benefit of being a uniformly-hostile open world. Stealth is everything to MGSV, but in Fallout 4 it is a small part of a much larger system. This is why Fallout 4's stealth remains, despite improvements, so mechanically basic. Light is a key part of enemy vision, for example, but you can't shoot out light bulbs. You have no means of distracting guards. The idea of actually sneaking past a group of enemies, rather than sneaking to make them explode, never really gets a look-in.\n\nAll of these characteristics, and the stark [HIDDEN] icon, bring to mind where this kind of stealth logic began. 1997's Thief by Looking Glass Software was the first FPS to make stealth the core mechanic, and many of its ideas survive intact. The idea that crouching doesn't just make you invisible, in the right light, but also makes enemies forget they ever saw you is perhaps Thief's most lasting mechanic.\n\nFurther Reading Fallout 4 review: Check your next-gen expectations at the vault door Pacing and plotting issues hamper the best content in this incredibly huge quest.\n\nFurther Reading Fallout 4: A fanboy\u2019s op-ed review It's a Fallout game\u2014and if that's enough to excite you, you're going to like it.\n\nIf Thief is the mechanical root for Fallout 4's stealth system, the series' own past dictates how it works. The 2D Fallout games made non-combat specialisations viable builds, a characteristic that the more combat-heavy Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 have had difficulty representing. The stealth system in Fallout 4 is essentially this combination of the two\u2014the nuts and bolts are classically-signposted FPS stealth mechanics, but their actual utility depends entirely on background stats.\n\nIt would be easy to say the sheer silliness of it all breaks the immersion, but this is a narrow view of what immersion in a videogame is. The gameness of a world, all those UI elements like a score or a life bar, and explicit systems can be powerful elements of immersion themselves. You can sacrifice narrative and visual logic with abandon, and many AAA games do, but as long as what the player's doing is enjoyable then they're not necessarily drawn out of that world.\n\nWhat it comes down to is a weakness in our critical vocabulary about games\u2014a grey zone around a system that's both a mash-up with easily-identified failings, and capable of delivering surreal genius on a regular basis. Something like this can't be labelled good, bad, or even lazy. It almost feels more organic than that. The kind of thing that no one designer would ever have come up with, but that different teams, over different games, have created through accumulation and accretion.\n\nI don't know what to call Bethesda's take on stealth: lunatic, stupid, brilliant, amazing, surreal, frustrating, nonsensical, irresistible. The rudimentary parts drive me crazy, but when you end up as a cross between Rambo and the Invisible Man it completely changes the game\u2014it almost feels like a cheat code. Fallout 4's stealth is a huge mess that's both wrong and irresistible at the same time. Even when you're the beneficiary, it's hard to tell whether you're laughing at it or with it.\n\nRich Stanton is a videogame journalist who has written for Eurogamer, Vice, The Guardian, and others.

{"71": "On Nov. 4, 2010, a small cell of al-Qaeda operatives convened at a Starbucks in Corvallis, Oregon, to review the details of their plot to kill 25,000 people in downtown Portland. The cell had three members: Hussein, an explosives expert; Youssef, a businessman turned jihadi recruiter; and Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a 19-year-old Somali-American college student.\n\nThe would-be terrorists had met earlier that year, after one of Mohamud\u2019s friends from the mosque recommended him to the Council, a secret jihadi organization that scoured the globe for potential operators. Hussein and Youssef flew to Oregon to meet the teen, whom they called \u201ca jewel in the rough.\u201d Together, the three conceived a plot to detonate an 1,800-pound bomb during Portland\u2019s Christmas tree lighting ceremony, a yearly Black Friday tradition in Pioneer Square, the city\u2019s main plaza. Mohamud chose the target. Hussein and Youssef designed and built the bomb.\n\nIt was time for a test run. After meeting at the coffee shop, the group drove to a remote spot in the countryside. There, Hussein showed Mohamud a smaller version of the device: a backpack filled with three pounds of explosives. They placed the bomb in a tree and walked away. Hussein handed Mohamud a cell phone and asked him to dial a number. The teenager obeyed \u2014 and a small explosion rattled the last yellow leaves on the trees.\n\nLater that day, the cell returned to Mohamud\u2019s apartment in Corvallis to record his farewell video. The teenager put on a white robe, a white-and-red headdress, and a camouflage jacket. He began to read his manifesto to the camera. \u201cFor as long as you threaten our security, your people will not remain safe,\u201d Mohamud said. \u201cAs your soldiers target our civilians, we will not fail to do so. Did you think that you could invade a Muslim land and we would not invade you?\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, on Nov. 26, 2010, Youssef picked up Mohamud from a friend\u2019s house in Portland. They met with Hussein and headed to a parking spot near the Comcast building, where the operators showed Mohamud a large white van. Hussein opened the side door, revealing six 55-gallon drums filled with fertilizer. On the front seat was the detonation mechanism: a cell phone, a 9-volt battery, and a switch. The whole van smelled of diesel.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\nThe three headed to a hotel in downtown Portland, where they prayed and ordered a pizza. They turned on the TV and watched the crowds march into Pioneer Square under light rain.\n\nAround sunset, Hussein and Mohamud drove the bomb to the chosen corner. Mohamud flipped the toggle switch attached to the detonator, arming the bomb. Youssef picked up Mohamud and Hussein in a different car and drove them to Union Station. As the three left the scene, Mohamud said he thought he saw his mother heading toward the ceremony.\n\nAfter dropping off Youssef at the train station, Hussein and Mohamud parked in a nearby garage. The explosives expert handed the teen a cell phone. The teenager dialed the detonator number. Nothing happened.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you get out of the car and try again?\u201d Hussein said.\n\nMohamud did as he was told. As he pressed the last button, he heard a group of people running at him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d someone yelled.\n\nSuddenly, Mohamud was on the ground. He could hear Hussein screaming, \u201cAllahu akbar!\u201d \u2014 God is great \u2014 over and over again. After the third or fourth time, the 17 arresting officers started to laugh.\n\nThe bomb Mohamud had tried to detonate was fake. The test explosion was staged. There was no secret council of militant leaders seeking a gifted Somali-American teenager to wage jihad. Youssef and Hussein were undercover FBI agents.\n\nID: 7350053\n\nThe Black Friday non-bombing of Portland was a federal government sting, the result of a yearlong operation involving dozens of people, a secret court order, and a massive surveillance apparatus.\n\n\n\nMohamud\u2019s mugshot. Multnomah County Sheriff Office via Getty Images ID: 7340213\n\nMohamud went to trial three years after his arrest. (Unless otherwise stated, the facts in this article come from the voluminous public record for his criminal case, including the 2,700-page trial transcript, as well as firsthand interviews with 11 people with knowledge of the case. The FBI, the Department of Justice, and Mohamud\u2019s attorneys declined to answer detailed questions. Mohamud did not respond to letters sent to him in prison.)\n\nIn court, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers attempted an entrapment defense, arguing that their client never indicated he wanted to attack Portland before the FBI contacted him. The prosecution said Mohamud\u2019s prior correspondence with two individuals suspected of working for al-Qaeda was evidence he was looking for \u201cthe right people\u201d \u2014 and that, had the FBI not intervened, he might have found them.\n\nThe jury convicted Mohamud. A judge sentenced him to 30 years in prison.\n\nThe story could have ended there. But, months after the trial, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers received an unexpected message from the government: At some point in the investigation, the FBI had used the 2008 amendments to the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, a law known as the FAA, to access Mohamud\u2019s communications without a particular warrant.\n\nMohamud is the very first defendant to\u200b potentially challenge the NSA\u2019s mass surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden before the U.S. Supreme Court. ID: 7349035\n\nThe notification was bewildering. The government is supposed to inform defendants they have been targeted by FAA spying before they go to trial, not after. More broadly, the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution \u2014 at least as many legal experts understand it \u2014 protects citizens and those living in the U.S. from warrantless surveillance.\n\nToday, Mohamud\u2019s lawyers are asking the 9th Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn their client\u2019s conviction. Their central argument is that the FBI\u2019s use of the FAA against Mohamud violated the Constitution.\n\nMohamud is the very first criminal defendant to challenge the FAA before a court of appeals, which opens the door for a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeal has widespread implications: The controversial law provides the legal framework for the mass surveillance programs that Edward Snowden revealed in 2013.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration,\u201d Patrick Toomey, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney, told BuzzFeed News, \u201cto say that the privacy rights of millions of Americans potentially hang in the balance of his case.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350052\n\nThe chain of events that led to Mohamud\u2019s appeal began in 1978, when Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence and Surveillance Act, or FISA. In its original version, the law forbade the government from spying within U.S. territory, unless it could convince a special court that the investigation\u2019s targets were \u201cagents of a foreign power.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe law was far from perfect: The special court met in secret and approved nearly all of the government\u2019s requests. (Of the 35,333 applications for FISA warrants filed between 1979 and 2013, only 12 were rejected outright.) Still, the act required the government to name the individuals it was targeting, specify the kind of communications it wanted to intercept, and give a timeline for the investigation \u2014 provisions that generally kept it in line with the Fourth Amendment.\n\nInstead of targeting individuals already engaged in criminal conduct, the FBI after Sept. 11, 2001, began focusing on people who it believed could potentially become terrorists. ID: 7349033\n\nAll of that changed after Sept. 11, 2001. Instead of treating terrorism as a crime to be solved after it happened, the government began to treat it as a disaster to be prevented. In 2002, President Bush signed a secret executive order authorizing the National Security Agency to monitor every email, telephone call, and text message in which at least one party was believed to be outside the U.S. \u2014 even if everyone else in the conversation was located within the country. The administration said the NSA didn\u2019t need any kind of warrant, from the FISA court or otherwise, because such communications counted as \u201cforeign\u201d rather than \u201cdomestic,\u201d and were therefore not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe FBI, however, faced a problem: All that monitoring of communications was turning up a lot of terrorist sympathizers, but not a lot of actual criminal activity. The bureau responded by refining one of its most controversial techniques: the sting operation. Instead of targeting individuals already engaged in criminal conduct, the FBI began focusing on people who it believed could potentially become terrorists.\n\nUnderlying many of these sting operations was a psychological doctrine \u2014 strongly challenged by several studies \u2014 known as \u201cradicalization theory,\u201d which held that individuals with extreme political opinions tended to look for like-minded people and eventually take violent action.\n\nMany American Muslims believe the government uses sting operations to unfairly target their communities and that radicalization theory contributes to Islamophobia. \u201cWhen people assume that one of their community members could be an informant for the government, that creates a ripple effect,\u201d Kayse Jama, a Somali-American organizer who works in Portland, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThey can\u2019t trust the people at their mosque. They can\u2019t trust anyone. They feel they can\u2019t speak freely.\u201d Studies suggest that at least some of Jama\u2019s fears are well-founded.\n\nFederal courts convict nearly 90% of those of accused of terrorism, most of them through guilty pleas. This means the facts of most homegrown terrorism cases are rarely entered into the public record, which in turn means the FBI is almost never forced to argue the legality of its techniques. Mohamud\u2019s case is one of few exceptions.\n\nID: 7350061\n\nMohamed Osman Mohamud was born on Aug. 11, 1991, in Mogadishu, Somalia. Months earlier, rebels had ousted the country\u2019s long-standing dictator, unleashing a civil war that rages to this day. On the way to the hospital, Mohamud\u2019s parents had to confront armed thugs. They were lucky to find a doctor who helped with the baby\u2019s breech birth.\n\n\n\nThe family fled to America. Mohamud\u2019s father, Osman Mohamud Barre, went first, quitting his engineering professorship at Somali National University. Mohamud stayed behind, spending a year in a Kenyan refugee camp with his mother, Mariam Hassan.\n\nThe U.S. granted Barre refugee status. He settled in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he worked 13 hours a day at an Intel assembly line. By 1993, he had saved enough money to bring his family to the U.S. \u201cThey were malnourished and suffering, but they were happy,\u201d Barre later testified at his son\u2019s trial. \u201cWe were grateful to America.\u201d\n\nBarre climbed the ranks at Intel. He and Mariam had two more children. They moved to Beaverton, a prosperous suburb in southwest Portland. Mohamud devoured the Harry Potter series and became an NBA fan. He did well in school and made friends easily. \u201cYou would never see him alone,\u201d Joshua Alinger, who befriended Mohamud in elementary school, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nEarly in high school, Mohamud became interested in religion, even as his parents became less observant. Several of his friends said many Muslim families in Beaverton felt that Mohamud exerted a positive influence. \u201cWhenever we tried to do something that went against our religion, like date a girl, [Mohamud] was like a stopping point,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s best friend, who is not identified in the public record and who spoke on condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHe would just give us that look.\u201d\n\nMohamud also joined in the hijinks of American adolescence. By junior year, he began skipping school. His best friend said the two of them would sneak out to a nearby community college to play pool. They made friends with an older student, who bought them alcohol and let them hang at his house. \u201cI think he wanted to be a normal suburban teenager,\u201d said James Duncan, an English teacher at Westville High School who oversaw Mohamud\u2019s study hall.\n\nLike many refugee children, Mohamud had to deal with cultural barriers that separated him from his parents, his American friends, and his mostly white classmates. There is little question he felt different. For an issue of the class magazine, for example, Duncan asked his students to draw cartoons of themselves and caption them. Under his portrait, Mohamud wrote, \u201cI\u2019m the black one.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Mariam and Barre began to go through a breakup, Mohamud\u2019s best friend said. \u201cHome was kind of a hostile environment for him,\u201d the friend said. \u201cHe tried to spend as much time as possible out of the house.\u201d\n\n(Reached at her home in suburban Portland, Mohamud\u2019s mother declined to comment, saying her son\u2019s attorneys had instructed her not to speak to reporters. \u201cBut one day,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ll be able to speak out about his case, inshallah\u201d \u2014 God willing. Mohamud\u2019s father did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nMariam Barre at her son\u2019s trial. Rick Bowmer / AP Photo ID: 7340349\n\nAs his parents\u2019 relationship deteriorated, Mohamud began spending more and more time at the Masjed As-Saber, a local mosque led by a Somali imam named Mohamed Kariye. The cleric had a complicated history. According to an immigration complaint, he spent part of his youth fighting with the Afghan mujahideen, a jihadi organization that counted Osama bin Laden among its supporters. (At the time, however, the U.S. supported the group in its fight against the Soviet Union.) In 2003, the FBI\u2019s counterterrorism unit arrested him and charged him with Social Security fraud. (The imam pleaded guilty and paid roughly $5,000 in fines.) Today, the government is trying to take away the imam\u2019s American citizenship.\n\nKariye\u2019s teaching \u2014 Wahhabism, a traditionalist Sunni practice \u2014 proved too restrictive for some members of Portland\u2019s Muslim community. The family of Mohamud\u2019s best friend, for example, used to attend Friday prayers at the Masjed As-Saber, but eventually switched to another congregation. Mohamud\u2019s parents, too, were \u201ctotally against the mosque,\u201d his best friend said. For the teenager, frequenting the masjed became a form of rebellion.\n\nAt Kariye\u2019s mosque, Mohamud met Amro al-Ali, an 18-year-old exchange student from Saudi Arabia. According to Marc Sageman, a former CIA officer who testified on \u201copen source information\u201d at Mohamud\u2019s trial, the Saudi was \u201ca wannabe\u201d who liked to talk big about jihad but was, at least at that point, \u201cnot a terrorist.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting al-Ali, Mohamud began frequenting extremist websites, where he answered a call for submissions to an English-language webzine called Jihadi Recollections. The publication was the brainchild of Samir Khan, a Pakistani-American editor based in North Carolina. Khan commissioned him to write an article on fitness training, marking the beginning of a six-month-long collaboration.\n\nBut then, on Aug. 15, 2009, four days after his 18th birthday, Mohamud cut off contact with Khan. He wrote to Khan saying he was \u201cgoing through a lot of things.\u201d\n\n(Shortly after Mohamud\u2019s last email, Khan traveled to Yemen, where he became the editor of Inspire, the English-language outlet of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. government killed him in 2011, in the same drone strike that killed Anwar al-Awlaki, a top al-Qaeda figure and a U.S. citizen.)\n\nMohamud was indeed going through a lot \u2014 his parents had finally divorced. \u201cYou could see his discontent, sadness, and unhappiness,\u201d the teen\u2019s grandmother told his defense team. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t listen to either one of them because there was no union. He definitely tried to talk them into staying together many, many times.\u201d\n\nIt was in that context that Mohamud received the email that sealed his fate. On Aug. 31, 2009, al-Ali sent him information about a religious school in Yemen. The thought of escaping to a distant land, away from his parents, appears to have seduced the teen. He stormed out of his mother\u2019s house and called his father to say he was moving to the Middle East. Barre tried to convince him to wait, but Mohamud said he already had a ticket and a visa. Barre called Mariam and asked her to look for their son\u2019s passport. It was missing.\n\nBarre panicked. He had heard stories about kids from Minnesota\u2019s Somali-American community who\u2019d been \u201cbrainwashed\u201d into joining the civil war. He remembered one news report of a teen who fled \u2014 the parents later found a photo of him on the internet \u201cshot in the head, dead, in Somalia.\u201d\n\nNot knowing who to call, Barre contacted the FBI. \u201cCan you guys help me to stop my son and make him not leave the country?\u201d he asked the agent who picked up the phone. The agent took down Mohamud\u2019s full name, date of birth, and address and told Barre to meet one of his colleagues at the parking lot of a local high school.\n\nMeanwhile, Mariam found her son. He was in a playground not far from her house. She took his passport and drove him back home.\n\nMohamed Mohamud is seen in this undated handout photo. Obtained by BuzzFeed News ID: 7340312\n\nThat afternoon, Barre met with FBI Special Agent Isaac DeLong, of the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \u201cWhy terrorism?\u201d Barre asked. \u201cAre you alluding that we are Muslim and my son\u2019s name is Mohamed? There\u2019s no terrorism here. We\u2019re citizens.\u201d\n\nBarre explained that he wanted to keep his son from returning to Somalia. DeLong replied that there was nothing the bureau could do, because Mohamud was an adult.\n\nThat evening, the father and son had a difficult conversation. \u201cI left my country because of violence,\u201d Barre told Mohamud. \u201cI brought you here to give you a life of prosperity.\u201d Mohamud told his father had nothing to hide: al-Ali, a friend from the mosque, had recommended a school in Yemen. \u201cYou can learn Arabic and Islam once you finish school here and become mature enough to know wrong or right,\u201d Barre replied.\n\nBarre forwarded al-Ali\u2019s email to the FBI, with a note saying he had spoken to Mohamud and the situation was under control. Unbeknownst to him, DeLong ran Mohamud\u2019s email address through what he described at trial as \u201can FBI database.\u201d The search, according to court records, turned out an interesting result: Mohamud had been in touch with the subject of another investigation \u2014 Samir Khan.\n\n\u201cI took this information to my superior,\u201d DeLong testified. \u201cWe decided to open a case.\u201d\n\nID: 7350063\n\nThe Bush administration\u2019s warrantless surveillance operations remained secret until December 2005, when the New York Times published an expos\u00e9. The article unleashed outrage that pushed the president to seek retroactive legislative approval for the program. In July 2008, the Senate approved the FISA Amendments Act, or FAA.\n\n\n\nThe new law overwrote many of FISA\u2019s provisions, empowering the attorney general and the director of national intelligence to authorize surveillance of people \u201creasonably believed to be located outside the United States.\u201d Those offices no longer had to get warrants, as the original law mandated. Instead, they simply had to present the FISA court with a set of general procedures meant to \u201cminimize\u201d the \u201cincidental\u201d surveillance of people in the U.S.\n\nOn the same day President Bush signed the FAA, the ACLU filed a suit saying the law violated the First and Fourth Amendments. \u201cThe act does not require the government to demonstrate that its surveillance targets are foreign agents,\u201d the ACLU wrote in its complaint. \u201cThe statute does not require the government to identify its surveillance targets at all.\u201d\n\nThe suit, Amnesty v. Clapper, reached the Supreme Court. In February 2013, however, Justice Samuel Alito delivered an opinion declining to hear the case. He said the only people with standing to challenge the act were criminal defendants who, unlike the ACLU, knew for certain that their communications had been intercepted. (At that time, the government had not informed a single defendant of its use of the FAA.)\n\nThen, in May 2013, Edward Snowden handed a group of journalists a cache of classified documents. The leaks detailed how the NSA invokes the FAA to intercept, store, and in some cases review the telephone and internet communications of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 many of them citizens and residents of the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear to what extent domestic law enforcement agencies have access to the immense databases of information obtained through warrantless surveillance. In the past, the government has said FBI agents assigned to criminal investigations cannot see the data.\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350065\n\nEarly in September 2009, Mohamud moved to Corvallis, a small city a few hours south of Portland, to attend classes at Oregon State University. It was too late to enroll officially, so he couldn\u2019t live in the dorms. His parents agreed to give him $300 a month for rent. Mohamud\u2019s best friend, however, had just started at OSU, where he shared a large dorm room with two other students. Since they had an extra bed, they invited Mohamud to live with them for free. In exchange, \u201cwe called his rent budget our booze budget,\u201d the friend said.\n\nFBI documents described Mohamud as a \u201cconfused college kid that talks mildly radical jihad out one ear, and drugs, sex, drinking out the other.\u201d ID: 7349037\n\nThe group soon expanded to include two young men, Raed and Mohamed. Two of Mohamud\u2019s roommates were dating a pair of best friends, and the dorm became the center of a tight-knit social scene. (The other roommates and the women declined requests for comment.) \u201cOur freshman year was a drunken mess,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s best friend said. \u201cIt was a blast.\u201d\n\nMohamud\u2019s friends from that time acknowledged he was easy to influence. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to drink anymore,\u2019 but he could be persuaded to do it,\u201d said Raed. \u201cLike, a friend of mine would be like, \u2018No, come on, let\u2019s just drink for one more week,\u2019 and he\u2019d say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s go.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe FBI, which trial testimony shows was already reading Mohamud\u2019s communications and had agents physically following him, agreed with Raed\u2019s assessment. (The bureau refuses to disclose when, exactly, the surveillance began.) In emails sent to other FBI agents in the fall of 2009, Special Agent DeLong wrote that the \u201cmanipulable\u201d and \u201cconflicted\u201d teen appeared to have \u201cleft behind his radical thinking.\u201d Christopher Henderson, the special agent who took over the case when Mohamud moved to Corvallis, described the teen in internal emails as \u201ca confused college kid that talks mildly radical jihad out one ear, and typical 18-year-old college kid (drugs, sex, drinking) out the other.\u201d\n\nMohamed Mohamud is seen in this undated handout photo. Obtained by BuzzFeed News ID: 7340475\n\nThen, on Halloween, Mohamud and his crew headed to a fraternity party. Mohamud \u201cwas drinking like a normal person, dancing with girls,\u201d and brought a woman home, Raed said. At the dorm, Raed said, they began having sex \u201cin front of everybody, on the top bunk.\u201d The friends eventually left the room.\n\nThe following morning, two Oregon State Police officers were in the dorm. The cops said that a young woman had filed a crime report accusing Mohamud of drugging and raping her.\n\nMohamud met with Detective Eli Chambers at the campus police office for a polygraph test. He denied having drugged the woman, but admitted that she was very drunk \u2014 \u201cmore drunk than I thought,\u201d Mohamud said, according to Chambers\u2019 report.\n\nChambers closed his investigation without pressing charges against Mohamud. Still, the incident rattled the student. After the polygraph, he wrote a long post in one of the forums he frequented:\n\nI swear by Allah I have become so lost. And I want so badly to be in a muslim land. I keep telling myself that if I lived in a muslim land I would become so pious. [\u2026] Being in University and living on campus hasn\u2019t helped me too much either. I have fallen into so many things (i.e. alcohol and women). [\u2026] All I need is some soft words to help my heart and supporting advice.\n\nInstead of soft words, Mohamud began receiving emails from Bill Smith, a recent convert to Islam who lived in eastern Idaho and wanted to \u201cget more involved in the fight\u201d against enemies of the Prophet. Smith, however, was a fictional character created by FBI Special Agent Jason Dodd of the Portland field office.\n\n(There were a number of oddities in Dodd\u2019s decision to begin an operation against Mohamud. At trial, the agent testified that Special Agent DeLong authorized the \u201cBill Smith\u201d emails, but DeLong could not recall such thing. Special Agent Elvis Chan, who would eventually run the operation that resulted in Mohamud\u2019s conviction, testified that he did not know about the \u201cBill Smith\u201d emails until after the arrest.)\n\nOn Nov. 12, 2009, just days after a Muslim U.S. Army major killed 13 people at the military base in Fort Hood, Bill Smith t0ld Mohamud that he had seen news reports of \u201cbrothers trying to fight.\u201d \u201cI want to, as well,\u201d Smith wrote in one of about two dozen emails. \u201cWhat can I do? Do you know who I can talk to? Can you help?\u201d Mohamud did not engage him, cautioning him instead to be careful about what he said on the internet.\n\nBut then, on Dec. 3, 2009, someone familiar reached out to Mohamud. \u201cSalamz bro,\u201d the message read. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Amro.\u201d Al-Ali said he was making a pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca, in Saudi Arabia. If Mohamud wanted to join, he said, a \u201cbro\u201d would contact him \u201cabout the proper paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe FBI agents traced al-Ali\u2019s computer not to Mecca, but to the northwestern border of Pakistan, one of the centers of violent jihad. The agents became convinced that al-Ali was writing in code, trying to recruit Mohamud as a fighter. Two months earlier, Interpol had issued an Arabic-language \u201cred notice\u201d \u2014 a sort of international \u201cwanted\u201d poster \u2014 saying al-Ali was \u201cknown to be connected to a fugitive wanted by Saudi Arabian authorities who is an expert in manufacturing explosives and in facilitating the movement of extremists inside Saudi Arabia,\u201d according to a translation included in a defense brief. \u201cHe also helped al-Qaeda division in Yemen and other countries by providing them with foreign fighters to carry out terrorist attacks against western and tourist interests.\u201d\n\n(Later, the defense and the prosecution had heated arguments about the notice, which was ambiguous in Arabic and became vaguer in translation. Was al-Ali a member of al-Qaeda, or merely associated with a member? The matter was further complicated when the Saudis captured al-Ali, holding him without charges and subjecting him to repeated interrogations. A former intelligence officer told BuzzFeed News that classified reports detailing those interrogations show that al-Ali didn\u2019t remember Mohamud.)\n\nMohamud responded that joining the pilgrimage would be \u201cwonderful.\u201d Al-Ali sent him a Gmail username and password, with instructions to log in to the account and draft, but not send, a message for a brother called Abdul Hadi. The FBI went on high alert, but Mohamud couldn\u2019t figure out the system. No messages were exchanged.\n\nToward the end of spring semester, one of Mohamud\u2019s roommates invited him to spend the summer working on a fishing boat in Alaska. Mohamud\u2019s parents thought it would help discipline their son. They bought him a plane ticket and, on June 14, 2010, drove him to Portland International Airport.\n\nThe family made it only to the security checkpoint, where an airline employee told Mohamud he couldn\u2019t board. As the family stood at the concourse, a man in a dark suit introduced himself as Special Agent Bradford Petrie. \u201cI understand Mohamed was not allowed to fly today,\u201d Petrie told the family. \u201cWe\u2019d like to talk about that if we could.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7350078\n\nA week earlier, the FBI had decided to launch a full-scale undercover operation against Mohamud. Miltiadis Trousas, an agent based in the FBI office in Eugene, Oregon, wrote to Special Agent Chan, a sting specialist based in San Francisco, to suggest targeting the teen \u201cusing everything we have on him,\u201d including the fact that he was \u201cshy around authority figures.\u201d When the agents learned of Mohamud\u2019s plans to travel to Alaska, they worried he might try to continue to Pakistan or Yemen. They placed him on the no-fly list.\n\n\n\nAt the Portland airport, Petrie brought Mohamud and his parents to a conference room. Barre asked whether his call to the FBI a year earlier had anything to do with his son\u2019s placement on the no-fly list. Mohamud denied visiting extremist websites. Petrie concluded the interview promising the family he\u2019d try to \u201chelp\u201d the teenager. He said nothing about the operation.\n\nA few days after the interview at the airport, Chan contacted an FBI agent in California and asked him to fly to Portland to play an \u201cal-Qaeda spotter\u201d in a sting against a suspected teenage radical. The agent, who had been born and raised in an Arabic country, assumed the name Youssef.\n\nYoussef got in touch with Mohamud nine days after the airport incident. The goal was to set up an in-person meeting, purportedly to assess whether the teen was serious about wanting to join a militant organization. The agent wrote in the voice of the \u201cbrother\u201d whom al-Ali had earlier told Mohamud to contact, and whom the teenager never reached out to. \u201cSalamz, bro,\u201d the message began. \u201cGo to hushmail.com and set up an account.\u201d Mohamud replied with an innocuous greeting from an encrypted account. Two days later, Youssef wrote back: \u201cAre you still able to help the brothers?\u201d\n\nMohamud wrote back something noncommittal. Youssef\u2019s next email suggested that God\u2019s plan for Mohamud was in Portland: \u201cAllah I\u2019m sure has good reason for you to stay where you are,\u201d the undercover agent wrote. He said he was traveling to Oregon and asked the teen to meet him in person.\n\nMohamud ignored the message. Worried about losing their target, the agents sent another. A week later, Mohamud responded by inviting Youssef to Friday services at the Masjed As-Saber. The FBI, however, did not want to send an undercover agent to a place of worship. Instead, the agent suggested meeting in downtown Portland. Mohamud grew suspicious. \u201cHow did you get my email?\u201d the teen wrote. \u201cAnd if Amro did give you my email, then how do you know him? And describe him to me if you really do know him.\u201d\n\nThe FBI did not know what al-Ali looked like. To avoid blowing Youssef\u2019s cover, the agents invented a fictional organization, which they called the \u201cIhata,\u201d or Council. They told Mohamud that \u201ca brother from Oregon\u201d told the Council about him, prompting the group to send Youssef to interview him. Flattered, Mohamud agreed to meet on July 30, 2010.\n\nFor the first meeting, Youssef wore a suit to match his cover: a business traveler with connections across many countries. He met Mohamud on a street corner and walked with him to the Embassy Suites, a hotel blocks away from Pioneer Square.\n\nThe public record of that meeting is incomplete. In what the FBI claimed was an honest mistake, Youssef\u2019s tape recorder had dead batteries. Apart from the anonymous agent\u2019s testimony, the only source for what Mohamud said that day is a summarized report prepared by Chan. At trial, Chan said he had destroyed his original notes.\n\n(The defense took great issue with this at trial. Entrapment law requires prosecutors to show that a defendant was predisposed to commit the crime before the first contact with government agents. The nuances of Mohamud\u2019s behavior and language during the first meeting, the defense argued, were vital.)\n\nIn the FBI\u2019s account of the meeting, Youssef and Mohamud sat at a table in a corner of the hotel lobby. The agent said the Council wanted to interview seven possible candidates in the U.S. and Canada.\n\n\u201cSo, what have you been doing to be a good Muslim?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\nMohamud said he\u2019d written religious poems and a couple of articles for Jihadi Recollections.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s pretty obvious that you can\u2019t go overseas,\u201d Youssef said. \u201cSo, what can you do for the cause? What do you want to do for the cause right now?\u201d\n\nInstead of answering with a concrete proposition, Mohamud told him about a dream in which he went to the mountains of Yemen, received training, and led a Muslim army against the infidels in Afghanistan. The undercover agent then repeated his question \u2014 what could the teen do for the cause? Mohamud said he could do \u201canything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave him five examples of how you could be a good Muslim,\u201d Youssef testified at trial. Mohamud, the agent said, could pray five times a day, train as a doctor and go overseas, donate money to the cause, become \u201coperational,\u201d or become \u201ca martyr.\u201d\n\nMohamud replied he wanted to become operational. Youssef asked what he meant. According to the FBI agent, the teen said he wanted to \u201cget a car, fill it with explosives, park it near a target location, and detonate the vehicle.\u201d Youssef told Mohamud he \u201chad a brother that could help him with explosives\u201d and instructed him \u201cto research possible places within the Portland area as possible targets.\u201d The two then parted ways.\n\nThe FBI brought a second undercover agent into the operation: a detective from a suburban police department in California assigned to his city\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Force. Like Youssef, the second agent was born and raised in an Arabic-speaking country. For the sake of the operation, he assumed the name Hussein. He prepared to play the role of a mature and deeply religious explosives expert.\n\nTwo weeks later, Mohamud met again with Youssef. The script for that meeting, the agent testified, was to \u201csell\u201d the teen to Hussein, who was supposed to be initially skeptical. Youssef and Mohamud went to a room at the Embassy Suites, where Hussein was waiting \u2014 and where the FBI had installed several hidden cameras. They shared a meal to break the Ramadan fast.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Hussein asked, according to his testimony.\n\nMohamud responded he wanted \u201ca truck or a car and explosives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be glad to sell you a truck!\u201d Hussein said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mohamud answered, \u201cI want it for something else.\u201d\n\nThe teen launched into a rant about the need to punish the U.S. for attacks against Muslims.\n\n\u201cYou know what\u2019s going on right now?\u201d Mohamud said, according to a transcript of the recordings included in the prosecution\u2019s trial memorandum. \u201cThe U.S. is losing the war. So they have resorted to intentionally killing civilians. And, you know, God, the glorified, the exalted, said in the Quran that if they kill your women and children intentionally, then you are allowed to do the same to them.\u201d\n\nThe conversation shifted toward more concrete plans. Had Mohamud found a target in the Portland area, like Youssef requested?\n\n\u201cDo you guys know Pioneer Square?\u201d the teen said. \u201cWhen they have events, everybody comes up there. So, on the 26th of November, they have a Christmas tree lighting and some 25,000 people attend. You know, the streets are packed. I thought, I thought if you could help me, you know, to have, to have a truck. \u2026 You know, explosives, inshallah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this is what\u2019s in your heart?\u201d Youssef said. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s going to be a lot of children there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\n\u201cFor kids?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\n\u201cNo, just for a huge mass,\u201d Mohamud said. \u201cYou know, for them to be attacked in their own element, with their families, celebrating the holidays.\u201d\n\nHussein asked Mohamud if he wanted to kill himself with the bomb.\n\nThe undercover FBI agent asked Mohamud if he wanted to kill himself with the bomb. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind that,\u201d the teen said. ID: 7349044\n\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t mind that,\u201d the teenager said. He began to stutter. \u201cThat, that, that, I mean, if I wasn\u2019t in it, then, you know, then, they\u2019ll look for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are not worried?\u201d Youssef asked.\n\n\u201cIf you were going to paradise, you wouldn\u2019t have to worry, right?\u201d Mohamud answered. \u201cYes, I will push the button.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllah is looking at you right now,\u201d Youssef said.\n\n\u201cYou know what I like, what makes me happy? You know what I like to see? When I see the enemy of Allah, and, you know, their bodies are torn everywhere,\u201d Mohamud said.\n\nAnticipating an entrapment defense and a jury of liberal Portlanders, the undercover agents made sure to give Mohamud a way out. \u201cWe want to make sure that it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s in your heart,\u201d Youssef told the teen. \u201cIf we get all the way there and you\u2019re like, uh-oh \u2014 even if that happens, we\u2019ll be disappointed, but you always have a choice, you understand? With us you always have a choice.\u201d\n\nOn the drive home, Mohamud burst into tears. After he left the car, with the cameras still rolling, Hussein looked at his partner. \u201cIt\u2019s almost too good to be true,\u201d he said.\n\nPioneer Courthouse Square, the site of Mohamud\u2019s attempted bombing, is seen on Nov. 27, 2010, in Portland, Oregon. Craig Mitchelldyer / Getty Images ID: 7340573\n\nOver the next few months, Youssef and Hussein met with Mohamud on five more occasions. They began giving him tasks. First, they sent him shopping for a timer, two cell phones, a toggle switch, and a snap connector. They asked him to find a few possible parking spots near Pioneer Square. Later, they told him to rent a storage shed where they could build the bomb.\n\nMore than anything else, they praised him: \u201cYou got a lot of talent, brother Mohamed.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re probably smarter than most people.\u201d \u201cI think you can be a great poet.\u201d \u201cI trust you with my life.\u201d \u201cWe love you, for the sake of Allah.\u201d\n\nAs the operation progressed, the two agents grew concerned that Mohamud was becoming suicidal, so they decided to tell the teen that the Council would help him flee to a Muslim country after the attack. They were also worried that Mohamud would tell someone, so they gave him $2,700 to rent an off-campus apartment away from his friends. In a moment of telling na\u00efvet\u00e9, the teenager asked the two men he thought were al-Qaeda recruiters to sign as his guarantors for the lease.\n\nThe change in Mohamud\u2019s lifestyle did not go unnoticed by his friends. He wouldn\u2019t show up to class or parties. He stopped going to Friday prayers at the Corvallis mosque. \u201cIn the beginning, I didn\u2019t really understand why he was drifting away,\u201d Mohamed, one of the college friends, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cAnd then Raed said, like, \u2018Hey man, we feel like there\u2019s something up. Like, he\u2019s not the same anymore.\u2019\u201d On the few occasions when they saw him, he seemed anxious and in distress.\n\n\u201cOne of my friends and I, we\u2019d be walking to a party,\u201d Raed said. \u201cAnd Mohamed would be extremely drunk, and he would go to one of my friends and say, \u2018Are you the FBI? Are you the FBI?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe night before the bombing, Mohamud had Thanksgiving dinner in Beaverton with a few friends. Afterward, they went shopping at a nearby mall. Several people who were there told BuzzFeed News that Mohamud seemed to be having a really good time. He insisted on buying coffee for everyone. He poured marshmallow liquor into his cup. He made jokes and laughed and acted like his old self, the way he used to be freshman year, before he moved out of the dorms and began spending all of his time alone.\n\n\u201cHe told me, \u2018I\u2019m having the greatest morning of my life,\u2019\u201d Raed, who ran into Mohamud at 4 a.m. outside a J.C. Penney, told BuzzFeed News.\n\nLater that day, Mohamud called his best friend to ask about his plans. The friend said he was going to see the Christmas tree lighting ceremony. Mohamud told him to stay home, but didn\u2019t explain. The two have not spoken since.\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7349079\n\nShortly after his arrest, Mohamud was appointed three lawyers from the Portland Federal Public Defender\u2019s Office: Steve Sady, Steve Wax, and Lisa Hay. According to attorneys from around the country, the three were among the best terrorism lawyers in the U.S. All three declined to comment.\n\n\n\nMohamud\u2019s trial began on Jan. 10, 2013, more than two years after the arrest. In her opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney Pamala Holsinger called Mohamud a \u201cprolific user\u201d of extremist websites, saying he was \u201cwell known\u201d for his work for Samir Khan.\n\nHolsinger said the government had contacted Mohamud because a \u201cknown terrorist\u201d was trying to recruit him. She said the government would prove Mohamud\u2019s attempt to travel to Alaska was a step toward his ultimate destination: Yemen. The prosecutor concluded by emphasizing the best evidence against Mohamud: \u201cThe defendant dialed this phone. And when the phone didn\u2019t go off, he dialed it again.\u201d\n\nSady, in his opening statement, accused the FBI of using \u201cflattery\u201d to get a manipulable teenager to do their bidding, invoking God and appealing to his fragile ego to make him do \u201cthe little things and big things that ended up bringing evidence into court today.\u201d The federal defender told the jury he understood the difficulty of putting aside emotion to acquit a person who thought he was carrying out a heinous act. He implored jurors to evaluate the case based on law rather than hypothetical destruction.\n\n\u201cWe all want law enforcement to stop crime\u200b,\u201d Mohamud\u2019s defense lawyer said.\u200b \u200b\u201cBut the FBI cannot create the very crime they intend to stop.\u201d ID: 7349050\n\n\u201cIn America, we don\u2019t create crime. The entrapment defense is how this fundamental American value is made real in the courts,\u201d Sady said. \u201cIt\u2019s a line the government cannot cross. We all want law enforcement to stop crime. But the FBI cannot create the very crime they intend to stop.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s case was a rare look into an FBI undercover investigation \u2014 warts and all. Over nine days, 14 agents took the stand. Several were forced to confront off-color comments caught on tape during surveillance. During his cross-examination, Special Agent Mario Galindo \u2014 who had just explained to the jury that the reason the first face-to-face meeting was not recorded was because he accidentally left the recorder powered on the night before the operation \u2014 was asked to confirm a sexually suggestive comment he made after Mohamud first met the bomb expert, Hussein.\n\nSady: Did you express a feeling of enthusiasm by using a metaphor for sexual excitement? Galindo: Which one? Sady: Did you say, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of people with woodies up here right now?\u201d Galindo: Yes, I said that.\n\nBoth undercover agents testified for days. At one point, Lisa Hay grilled Youssef:\n\nHay: Did Mohamud say what kind of truck? Youssef: He did not. Hay: So the FBI decided what kind of truck, didn\u2019t they? Youssef: Yes. Hay: The FBI decided the size of the bomb? Youssef: Yes. Hay: The FBI designed the bomb? Youssef: Yes.\n\nMohamud didn\u2019t testify in his own defense, though both his parents did. Barre told the court that he wished he had read his son\u2019s text messages to see what was going on with him. Then, during cross-examination by prosecutor Ethan Knight, the distraught father attacked the actions of the FBI:\n\nKnight: You were concerned, and that\u2019s why you went to the FBI? Barre: I went to the FBI to get help to stop him not to leave the country. Knight: Because you were concerned that he might be brainwashed, isn\u2019t that right? Barre: That is what I was afraid of. But can I tell you, the FBI brainwashed my son.\n\nSeveral of Mohamud\u2019s friends took the stand on his behalf, calling him \u201cgoofy\u201d and \u201cfun-loving.\u201d Raed, however, was subpoenaed to testify for the prosecution. He wasn\u2019t happy about it and found a small way to rebel.\n\n\u201cThe prosecution, they were like, \u2018Make sure you look at the jury and you talk to them eye to eye,\u2019\u201d Raed told BuzzFeed News. \u201cBut I\u2019m like, no. If I were here on the defense side, sure, I can be talking straight to the jury. But I\u2019m here because I\u2019m forced to. So I\u2019m going to answer your questions and go on with my day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did look at Mohamed,\u201d Raed went on. \u201cWe did make eye contact. He was crying.\u201d\n\nThe trial closed after 14 days. Knight gave the government\u2019s summation. He reminded the jury that Mohamud had believed the bomb was real. The case, Knight argued, was about \u201ca choice, a single and remarkable choice by this defendant to take the lives of thousands of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn individual simply cannot be entrapped to commit an offense such as this,\u201d Knight said. \u201cThis is the type of offense that one commits only because one wholeheartedly wants to.\u201d\n\nSteven T. Wax, left, and Stephen R. Sady, right. Rick Bowmer / AP Photo ID: 7340513\n\nSady, the defense lawyer, gave an impassioned closing argument, citing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet novelist who was forced into exile after publishing The Gulag Archipelago. \u201cSolzhenitsyn says, \u2018There is a line between good and evil that runs through the hearts of all people,\u2019\u201d Sady said. \u201cThe government shouldn\u2019t be pushing that line.\u201d\n\nAfter seven hours of deliberations, the jury returned a guilty verdict.\n\nNine months later, Mohamud was sentenced. The government asked that Mohamud be given 40 years in prison, while his defense team pleaded for 10 years. Judge Garr King sentenced Mohamud to 30, citing a case of \u201cimperfect entrapment\u201d carried out by the government.\n\n\u201cNow, the jury found that defendant was not entrapped, but imperfect entrapment is available as a defense,\u201d King said from the bench. \u201cAnd in this case, it weighs slightly in favor of defendant in this case. The court realizes the agents often reminded the defendant he could back out of the plan if he had a change of heart, but that is balanced by the government\u2019s inducement through the agent\u2019s use of praise and religious references.\u201d\n\nMarc Aspinall for BuzzFeed News ID: 7349085\n\nJust over a month after Mohamud\u2019s conviction, the Supreme Court published its decision not to hear the ACLU lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act, or FAA. As a criminal defendant who had been charged using evidence obtained through warrantless surveillance, Mohamud was one of the people who the court believed had standing to sue in place of the ACLU. The government, however, did not notify him of the surveillance until nearly a year after his conviction.\n\nSady and his team furiously litigated the issue. They filed a motion asking the court to force the government to disclose what it had learned about Mohamud using FAA warrantless surveillance. Although the attorneys were careful not to single out particular pieces of evidence for scrutiny, their motion hinted at many possible questions. Did the FBI database that Special Agent DeLong searched when he found out that Mohamud corresponded with Khan include electronic data swept up by FAA laws? What about other types of FAA surveillance that had become publicly known since the Snowden disclosures? Were those surveillance methods used against Mohamud? Could Mohamud be sure he hadn\u2019t been targeted in a myriad of ways, some of them potentially unconstitutional?\n\nFor Mohamud, those questions meant the difference between prison and a new trial. Under a legal doctrine known as \u201cthe fruit of the poisonous tree,\u201d courts must suppress any evidence that has roots in illegal government conduct, even if a warrant is later issued to legally obtain the same evidence. If it turns out that unconstitutional surveillance first led the FBI to Mohamud, the prosecution\u2019s entire case could collapse.\n\nJudge King, however, denied Mohamud\u2019s request for more information about the FBI\u2019s tactics, saying he would review the legality of the surveillance in private meetings with prosecutors.\n\nMohamud\u2019s attorneys resorted to broader legal arguments. Much like the ACLU, they claimed the FAA provided \u201cnone of the protections that the First and Fourth Amendments require to limit governmental intrusions on privacy.\u201d A vein of frustration ran through the pleadings, with the defense acknowledging at one point that it sought \u201csuppression of unknown evidence [\u2026] gathered at unknown times by unknown means by unknown persons and agencies operating under unknown protocols.\u201d\n\nThe government responded that the warrantless surveillance in the case did not originally target Mohamud, but rather unspecified foreigners living abroad \u201cwho generally are not protected by the Fourth Amendment.\u201d The fact that communications belonging to American citizens living within the borders of their own country \u2014 such as Khan and Mohamud \u2014 might have been \u201cincidentally\u201d acquired under the authority of the FAA did not \u201crender the collection unreasonable.\u201d\n\nAgain, Judge King sided with the prosecution, denying Mohamud\u2019s request for a new trial. (King declined a request for an interview.)\n\nOn Sep. 4, 2015, Mohamud\u2019s attorneys filed a brief asking the 9th Circuit of the Court of Appeals to overturn King\u2019s decision. The government has until December to file its response. Oral arguments could happen as soon as January 2016. Regardless of the outcome, the losing party is likely to appeal the matter before the Supreme Court.\n\nA victory for the defense could end a significant chapter in the history of American law enforcement. It would follow other incremental decisions \u2014 including June\u2019s passing of the USA Freedom Act, which curbed an NSA program that collected most Americans\u2019 phone records \u2014 that have begun to roll back the emergency policies enacted in the tense days after Sept. 11. Crucially, it wouldn\u2019t just end particular programs, but establish a principle that will guide how courts must balance individual rights against collective security.\n\nBy contrast, a victory for the prosecution would not just keep Mohamud in prison, but also continue the preventive approach to law enforcement that has developed since Sept. 11.\n\n\u201cThe history of the criminal justice system demonstrates that infringements on rights begin in cases against a particular targeted group that does not have any public support,\u201d Joshua Dratel, a defense attorney who has represented many American Muslims accused of terrorism, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cHowever, over time those methods that get approved in those cases contaminate ordinary cases against ordinary persons, and especially against those who have politically unpopular opinions.\u201d\n\nID: 7349087\n\nOn a recent autumn evening, Raed and Mohamed met at a bar in Corvallis to share memories about their friend, the convicted terrorist. The two hadn\u2019t talked about Mohamud for a while, in part because things had been rough around campus after he got arrested.\n\n\u201cI mean, my name is Mohamed,\u201d Mohamed told BuzzFeed News. \u201cA lot of racist things have happened to me, many times, even before the incident. Afterwards, when I was on campus and people knew I knew Mohamed or hung out with him, they\u2019d say things like, \u2018Oh, Mo, you fucking terrorist!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad, you know,\u201d Raed said, as he flipped through Facebook photos showing himself and his friends at an anti-jihad rally. \u201cFor us to have to show up and be like, \u2018No, this isn\u2019t really us.\u2019\u201d\n\nWould they want to see him again? The friends said nothing for a long time. Eventually, Mohamed broke the silence.\n\n\u201cThe only reason I\u2019d want to see him again would be to sit down with him, just like this,\u201d he said, making a sweeping gesture over the table. \u201cBecause I\u2019m curious. I want to figure out why. I want to say to him, \u2018Some of your friends were [at Pioneer Square]. Why did you want to do it to them?\u2019 Not \u2018Why did you want to do it to everybody?\u2019 Because he, at that time, obviously did not care about everybody. But he had such a close relationship with so many people who were there or could have been there. Why would he specifically want to do that to them?\u201d\n\nRaed then mentioned that Mohamud had written him a few times from prison. \u201cThey\u2019re, like, normal conversations,\u201d he said of the letters. \u201cLike we\u2019re talking like friends. He\u2019s asking how am I doing, how\u2019s my family doing, how\u2019re our friends doing.\u201d\n\nRaed never wrote back."}
{"72": "Eric Berger For the first time in more than four decades, three WB-57 aircraft flew together on Thursday. Here's a view from the ground at Houston's Ellington Field. Eric Berger For the first time in more than four decades, three WB-57 aircraft flew together on Thursday. Here's a view from the ground at Houston's Ellington Field. Eric Berger No pressure suits needed today because the pilots were only going up to about 30,000 feet. Eric Berger The WB-57 is a stubby aircraft, with a 37.5-meter wingspan and just a 20-meter length. Eric Berger The goal for Thursday's flight was to show the three aircraft off to Houston during a one-hour flight around the city. Eric Berger Each flight has a pilot, forward, and sensor operator. Eric Berger The first WB-57 begins taxiing. Eric Berger The second WB-57 follows the first down the long runway at Ellington Airport, which the city of Houston hopes to turn into a spaceport one day. Eric Berger The first WB-57 begins to take off from the ground. Eric Berger The first WB-57 is away. Eric Berger And then there were two. Eric Berger And finally, the third bird joined its two companions in the air.\n\nThe last three flightworthy WB-57 airplanes in existence arrayed themselves on a runway near Johnson Space Center in Houston this past week, as if they were dinosaurs brought to life. The long-winged aircraft look something like prehistoric creatures, too, measuring just a stubby 21 meters long compared to an overly broad 37.5-meter wingspan. It had been four decades since as many as three of the great, superannuated birds soared together.\n\nBut then they did. One by one, the WB-57s slowly rolled down the runway at Ellington Airport and then began a slow climb upward into resplendent clear, blue skies. They flew again, thanks to a restoration program by NASA to bring a third WB-57 back from its boneyard. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a day,\u201d Charlie Mallini, who manages the WB-57 program for NASA, told Ars.\n\nSince 1972 NASA has flown WB-57s as part of a broad ranging science mission. Recently two of the aircraft flew high above hurricanes Joaquin and Patricia, major storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean. They have also flown missions as varied as collecting cosmic dust samples from comets and asteroids in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, investigating clouds and studying the environmental effect of plumes from the Titan, Space Shuttle, Delta, Atlas and Athena rockets on the stratosphere.\n\nThe B-57 line of aircraft dates back to 1944, when the English Electric Company began developing the plane. After the Royal Air Force showcased the B-57 in 1951 by crossing the Atlantic in a record 4 hours and 40 minutes, and becoming the first jet-powered aircraft to span the Atlantic without refuelling, the United States Air Force began buying them to replace its aging Douglas B-26 Invader.\n\nThe aircraft performed bombing missions in Vietnam and other military campaigns, and a variant that later became the WB-57 was designed with longer wings that could fly even higher, up to 62,000 feet. This proved useful for weather reconnaissance and, around the world, to sample the upper atmosphere for evidence of nuclear debris where US officials suspected the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.\n\nEric Berger Before a high-altitude flight the pilot, left, and sensor officer must don their pressure suits. Here's a look at how the process goes. Eric Berger Before a high-altitude flight the pilot, left, and sensor officer must don their pressure suits. Here's a look at how the process goes. Eric Berger The suits come in 12 different sizes and then are modified further to fit each crew person. Eric Berger NASA, and the Air Force, are big on checklists. This emergency checklist is conveniently located in case the crew have to eject from the aircraft. Eric Berger Best to make sure the helmet has a tight seal. Eric Berger The suits need to be fully inflated to test their integrity. Eric Berger Always good advice when you're working with pure oxygen. Eric Berger When fully inflated the pressure suits are rigid, like an overfilled balloon. Only these suits don't pop. Eric Berger How do you eat in a pressurized suit? Through a tube. After six hours of flying, 10 cups of coffee's worth of caffeine in a tube comes in handy. Eric Berger Don't worry. If you don't like caffeinated chocolate pudding, there are a bunch of other flavors.\n\nAs the Air Force began phasing out the planes in the early 1970s, NASA was interested in using them for its programs to study Earth. NASA acquired its first WB-57 in 1972, which was retired in 1982. It later obtained two more, which have continued flying until today. Then, in 2013, NASA found a third WB-57 in the \u201cboneyard\u201d at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. After two years of restoration, it returned to flying status. This plane, now known as NASA 927, set a record\u2014more than four decades\u2014for the time between its mothballing and return to flight. For some replacement parts, Mallini said, NASA had to go to museums.\n\nFinally, last week, all three aircraft were ready to fly in tandem around the city of Houston, not at 62,000 feet, but at a much lower altitude so they could buzz the space center, downtown and the Astrodome. Under clear skies they put on a spectacular show. After the fun, science missions resume next week.\n\nListing image by Eric Berger"}
{"73": "Philip K. Dick's 1962 novel The Man In The High Castle imagined a world in which the Axis nations of Germany and Japan won World War II\u2014and won so decisively that they overtook the United States. To promote its TV series version of the book, Amazon Studios perhaps took that premise a little too literally by filling a New York City subway car with Nazi symbols on Monday.\n\nBy Tuesday, after photos and criticisms about the ad campaign had spread via social media, and New York mayor Bill De Blasio had called them \"irresponsible and offensive,\" the New York Metro Transit Authority had confirmed the ad campaign's closure. A Variety report quoted MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz as saying, \"Amazon has just decided to pull the ads.\" Amazon did not immediately respond to questions from Ars about the report and the campaign's closure.\n\nAs Twitter photos reveal, the ad campaign covered many subway benches on the MTA's S line with giant, flag-styled designs; one of those combined an American flag, a Nazi Eagle, and an Iron cross, while the other retouched Japan's war flag variant with American colors and stars. Next to these were window posters telling people to watch Man In The High Castle's entire first season on Amazon Video beginning November 20. (The full-train ads, which also coated those S trains' exteriors, didn't appear to mention that Amazon also sold the book version in both paper and Kindle editions.)\n\nBefore the Amazon ad campaign was pulled, A New York Magazine report quoted MTA spokesperson Adam Lisberg as saying the ads did \"not violate any of the content-neutral ad standards that our board adopted earlier this year.\"\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica"}
{"74": "There's a story going around today that the Web is too slow, especially over mobile networks. It's a pretty good story\u2014and it's a perpetual story. The Web, while certainly improved from the days of 14.4k modems, has never been as fast as we want it to be, which is to say that the Web has never been instantaneous.\n\nCuriously, rather than a focus on possible cures, like increasing network speeds, finding ways to decrease network latency, or even speeding up Web browsers, the latest version of the \"Web is too slow\" story pins the blame on the Web itself. And, perhaps more pointedly, this blame falls directly on the people who make it.\n\nThe average webpage has increased in size at a terrific rate. In January 2012, the average page tracked by HTTPArchive transferred 1,239kB and made 86 requests. Fast forward to September 2015, and the average page loads 2,162kB of data and makes 103 requests. These numbers don't directly correlate to longer page load-and-render times, of course, especially if download speeds are also increasing. But these figures are one indicator of how quickly webpages are bulking up.\n\nNative mobile applications, on the other hand, are getting faster. Mobile devices get more powerful with every release cycle, and native apps take better advantage of that power.\n\nSo as the story goes, apps get faster, the Web gets slower. This is allegedly why Facebook must invent Facebook Instant Articles, why Apple News must be built, and why Google must now create Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Google is late to the game, but AMP has the same goal as Facebook's and Apple's efforts\u2014making the Web feel like a native application on mobile devices. (It's worth noting that all three solutions focus exclusively on mobile content.)\n\nFor AMP, two things in particular stand in the way of a lean, mean browsing experience: JavaScript... and advertisements that use JavaScript. The AMP story is compelling. It has good guys (Google) and bad guys (everyone not using Google Ads), and it's true to most of our experiences. But this narrative has some fundamental problems. For example, Google owns the largest ad server network on the Web. If ads are such a problem, why doesn't Google get to work speeding up the ads?\n\nThere are other potential issues looming with the AMP initiative as well, some as big as the state of the open Web itself. But to think through the possible ramifications of AMP, first you need to understand Google's new offering itself.\n\nWhat is AMP?\n\nTo understand AMP, you first need to understand Facebook's Instant Articles. Instant Articles use RSS and standard HTML tags to create an optimized, slightly stripped-down version of an article. Facebook then allows for some extra rich content like auto-playing video or audio clips. Despite this, Facebook claims that Instant Articles are up to 10 times faster than their siblings on the open Web. Some of that speed comes from stripping things out, while some likely comes from aggressive caching.\n\nBut the key is that Instant Articles are only available via Facebook's mobile apps\u2014and only to established publishers who sign a deal with Facebook. That means reading articles from Facebook's Instant Article partners like National Geographic, BBC, and Buzzfeed is a faster, richer experience than reading those same articles when they appear on the publisher's site. Apple News appears to work roughly the same way, taking RSS feeds from publishers and then optimizing the content for delivery within Apple's application.\n\nAll this app-based content delivery cuts out the Web. That's a problem for the Web and, by extension, for Google, which leads us to Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages project.\n\nUnlike Facebook Articles and Apple News, AMP eschews standards like RSS and HTML in favor of its own little modified subset of HTML. AMP HTML looks a lot like HTML without the bells and whistles. In fact, if you head over to the AMP project announcement, you'll see an AMP page rendered in your browser. It looks like any other page on the Web.\n\nAMP markup uses an extremely limited set of tags. Form tags? Nope. Audio or video tags? Nope. Embed tags? Certainly not. Script tags? Nope. There's a very short list of the HTML tags allowed in AMP documents available over on the project page. There's also no JavaScript allowed. Those ads and tracking scripts will never be part of AMP documents (but don't worry, Google will still be tracking you).\n\nAMP defines several of its own tags, things like amp-youtube , amp-ad, or amp-pixel . The extra tags are part of what's known as Web components, which will likely become a Web standard (or it might turn out to be \"ActiveX part 2,\" only the future knows for sure).\n\nSo far AMP probably sounds like a pretty good idea\u2014faster pages, no tracking scripts, no JavaScript at all (and so no overlay ads about signing up for newsletters). However, there are some problematic design choices in AMP. (At least, they're problematic if you like the open Web and current HTML standards.)\n\nAMP re-invents the wheel for images by using the custom component amp-img instead of HTML's img tag, and it does the same thing with amp-audio and amp-video rather than use the HTML standard audio and video . AMP developers argue that this allows AMP to serve images only when required, which isn't possible with the HTML img tag. That, however, is a limitation of Web browsers, not HTML itself. AMP has also very clearly treated accessibility as an afterthought. You lose more than just a few HTML tags with AMP.\n\nIn other words, AMP is technically half baked at best. (There are dozens of open issues calling out some of the most egregious decisions in AMP's technical design.) The good news is that AMP developers are listening. One of the worst things about AMP's initial code was the decision to disable pinch-and-zoom on articles, and thankfully, Google has reversed course and eliminated the tag that prevented pinch and zoom.\n\nBut AMP's markup language is really just one part of the picture. After all, if all AMP really wanted to do was strip out all the enhancements and just present the content of a page, there are existing ways to do that. Speeding things up for users is a nice side benefit, but the point of AMP, as with Facebook Articles, looks to be more about locking in users to a particular site/format/service. In this case, though, the \"users\" aren't you and I as readers; the \"users\" are the publishers putting content on the Web.\n\nIt's the ads, stupid\n\nThe goal of Facebook Instant Articles is to keep you on Facebook. No need to explore the larger Web when it's all right there in Facebook, especially when it loads so much faster in the Facebook app than it does in a browser.\n\nGoogle seems to have recognized what a threat Facebook Instant Articles could be to Google's ability to serve ads. This is why Google's project is called Accelerated Mobile Pages. Sorry, desktop users, Google already knows how to get ads to you.\n\nIf you watch the AMP demo, which shows how AMP might work when it's integrated into search results next year, you'll notice that the viewer effectively never leaves Google. AMP pages are laid over the Google search page in much the same way that outside webpages are loaded in native applications on most mobile platforms. The experience from the user's point of view is just like the experience of using a mobile app.\n\nGoogle needs the Web to be on par with the speeds in mobile apps. And to its credit, the company has some of the smartest engineers working on the problem. Google has made one of the fastest Web browsers (if not the fastest) by building Chrome, and in doing so the company has pushed other vendors to speed up their browsers as well. Since Chrome debuted, browsers have become faster and better at an astonishing rate. Score one for Google.\n\nThe company has also been touting the benefits of mobile-friendly pages, first by labeling them as such in search results on mobile devices and then later by ranking mobile friendly pages above not-so-friendly ones when other factors are equal. Google has been quick to adopt speed-improving new HTML standards like the responsive images effort, which was first supported by Chrome. Score another one for Google.\n\nBut pages keep growing faster than network speeds, and the Web slows down. In other words, Google has tried just about everything within its considerable power as a search behemoth to get Web developers and publishers large and small to speed up their pages. It just isn't working.\n\nOne increasingly popular reaction to slow webpages has been the use of content blockers, typically browser add-ons that stop pages from loading anything but the primary content of the page. Content blockers have been around for over a decade now (No Script first appeared for Firefox in 2005), but their use has largely been limited to the desktop. That changed in Apple's iOS 9, which for the first time put simple content-blocking tools in the hands of millions of mobile users.\n\nCombine all the eyeballs that are using iOS with content blockers, reading Facebook Instant Articles, and perusing Apple News, and you suddenly have a whole lot of eyeballs that will never see any Google ads. That's a problem for Google, one that AMP is designed to fix."}
{"75": "Less than a week after Torquing Group announced that it was dissolving, Kickstarter said it is mystified as to how the British startup and its Zano drone raised $3.4 million in less than a year then totally collapsed.\n\nIn a statement sent to backers on Monday, Kickstarter wrote that it was \"extremely frustrated by what\u2019s happened with this project.\"\n\nWe learned the news of the Zano bankruptcy the same way that you did\u2014through a bare-bones project update. We e-mailed the creators as recently as two weeks ago to encourage them to be more communicative with their backers, but received only a cursory response. You deserve more than that, and we are committed to helping backers get to the bottom of what happened here. Today we sent an e-mail to the Zano team informing them of their obligations to backers and asking them to share an open and transparent update on what happened with the project. We have asked them to post this update by Monday, November 30. If they do not adequately brief backers by that time, Kickstarter will independently pursue an inquiry into the Zano project. Should this occur, we will share those findings with you, the backers, once completed.\n\nFurther Reading After raising record $3.4M on Kickstarter, UK drone startup collapses Torquing Group only shipped 600 of the more than 15,000 Zano drones ordered. David Gallagher, a Kickstarter spokesman, did not immediately answer Ars\u2019 questions as to what exactly this \"inquiry\" would entail, nor how often Kickstarter has engaged in such activity previously. [UPDATE 3:19pm ET: Gallagher responded, declining to answer Ars' questions.]\n\nAccording to one Zano-owner Facebook group, the Pembrokeshire County Council is also conducting its own inquiry.\n\nFor now, Ars is unaware of any lawsuits filed by or on behalf of Zano backers. Some backers have alternatively started a petition demanding a full refund from company founders (including, bizarrely, Prime Minister David Cameron). At this point, it seems unlikely that anyone will see any money returned from Kickstarter or the company itself. Kickstarter's terms of service currently provide only general guidelines if such a project falls apart.\n\n\"The creator is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their project. If they\u2019re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers,\" the site states.\n\nJust four percent of drones shipped\n\nEarlier this month, cofounder and CEO Ivan Reedman abruptly left Torquing Group, citing \"personal health issues and irreconcilable differences.\" Neither Torquing Group nor Reedman himself has responded to Ars\u2019 request for comment since his resignation.\n\nIn January 2015, Torquing Group concluded its Kickstarter campaign to fund production of its handheld drone. It raised more than \u00a32.3 million ($3.4 million) in under two months.\n\nWhen Ars visited the company headquarters in May 2015, Reedman promised that the drone would be shipping in July 2015 (it did not). Torquing also declined to demonstrate the drone in flight for us. When the BBC visited earlier this year, the news agency reported notable problems as well.\n\nTo date, Torquing Group has only shipped 600 of the more than 15,000 drones ordered.\n\nFurther Reading With a July launch, Europe\u2019s largest Kickstarter still won\u2019t show working drones It raised $3.4M in two months, but questions remain about Torquing Group's Zano drone. An American backer, Bill Reeves, told Ars he spent $340.13 for a camouflage drone that he is unlikely to ever receive. \"I don\u2019t understand how all of that initial prototype video of the Zano project at the Kickstarter launch\u2014looked like Zano was working just fine\u2014and the updated progress information from the company over the last year has culminated in this totally negative situation,\" he e-mailed.\n\nReeves also passed along an e-mail sent to backers from Gary Stones, the liquidator hired to formally end the company and repay any creditors. Stones warned that any money that Kickstarter backers spent \"are not debts owed by the company nor are they equity investments.\"\n\nAs such, Stones concluded: \"Without remotely being inconsiderate, any Kickstarter \u2018backers\u2019 that attempt to gain access at the creditors\u2019 meeting on December 4, 2015 will be refused entry.\"\n\nThe Swansea-based liquidator did not immediately respond to Ars\u2019 request for comment."}
{"76": "Canary first flew onto the smart home scene in 2013 when it was just another Indiegogo campaign hoping to become the next big thing. Now, two years and nearly $2 million in backing funds later, Canary is a full-fledged home security camera.\n\nWhen it originally debuted, Canary retailed for $249, which is a steep price to pay even with its HD video recording and automatic night vision. But now that it's a bit more affordable at $199, Canary is stiff competition for Nest Cam, Netatmo's Welcome, and other smart home cameras. With a few unique, useful features, Canary hopes to win households over by being not only a good surveillance camera, but a solid security device as well.\n\nSPECS AT A GLANCE: CANARY CAMERA RESOLUTION 1080p FIELD OF VIEW 147 degrees INTERNET 2.4GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n),connected Ethernet LIVE STREAMING Yes NIGHT VISION Yes MOTION/SOUND DETECTION Yes MOBILE APP Android and iOS SUBSCRIPTION Canary plans: $5, $10, and $30 per month plans PRICE $199 OTHER PERKS 90dB+ siren, ambient light sensor, temperature, humidity, and air quality detection\n\nDesign\n\nIf you saw a Canary on a shelf in someone's home, you might not know what it was at first. About the size of a can of spray paint, Canary is a tubular black device wrapped in a satin metal finish\u2014mine was silver, but you can get Canary with a white or black finish as well. The camera lens is positioned where the silver wrapper meets, and the bottom of the device glows with a faint reddish-yellow light when it's active.\n\nOn the back of Canary is a microUSB port that connects to its power adapter, an audio jack that is only used to securely connect the device to your smartphone during setup, and an Ethernet port. While I set up Canary using my Wi-Fi network, I appreciate the addition of the Ethernet cable because you could get a stronger Internet connection if you place Canary within reach of your router or modem.\n\nSetting up Canary isn't difficult, but it does take longer than the Nest Cam. Once you download the free Canary app for Android or iOS, you plug Canary into a power source and open the app to begin. It'll ask you to allow location services and then ask you a few questions about your home, including your address. It might seem weird for a security camera to know your home address, but this helps Canary automatically pull local police and medical services phone numbers and add them to your emergency call list.\n\nLike the Nest Cam, you indicate which room Canary will be surveilling and then proceed to connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet. Then, Canary asks you to plug in the yellow cable it came with to that third port in its back, and plug the other end into the audio jack of your smartphone. Once it has established a secure connection, you're nearly done: Canary had a firmware update, so I had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the device to get up to speed.\n\nCanary is a security camera you might want to show off\u2014inconspicuously. It's elegant enough to blend into modernly designed homes, but small and nondescript enough to go unnoticed by passersby. It's not as lithe or tiny as the Nest Cam, but Canary wasn't made to be hidden or to stealthily disappear in between bookcases.\n\nImage quality\n\nCanary records video at 1080p, which the same resolution as both the Nest Cam and the Netatmo Welcome. The live video feed had about a seven-second delay when I viewed it from my iPhone 6, but the audio was loud and clear. I was impressed with its night vision recordings as they seemed slightly sharper than those of the Nest Cam. Objects, both moving and still, were crisp and even things further away from the camera had some definition. Night vision automatically comes on during the evening, or when it's just super dark in the room.\n\nValentina Palladino Canary weighs only .87 pounds, so it's light enough to be moved anywhere in your home. Valentina Palladino Canary weighs only .87 pounds, so it's light enough to be moved anywhere in your home. Valentina Palladino Canary's design is simple yet elegant; it has the potential to complement home decor. Valentina Palladino The bottom of Canary, featuring its speakers from which the 90+ dB alarm sounds. Valentina Palladino The lens of Canary's camera sits on the top portion of the front of the device. Valentina Palladino The back of Canary, with its Ethernet port, microUSB port, and audio jack.\n\nFeatures\n\nLike most home security cameras, Canary's main job is to let you know when unexpected movement or sound is detected in your home. The device recognizes motion and sound, and depending on the mode it's in, Canary will notify you via smartphone alerts. Canary has three modes: Armed, which detects and records motion and sound, alerting you immediately; Disarmed, which records motion and sound but doesn't notify you; and Privacy, which turns the camera and microphone off completely.\n\nDisarmed is the default mode, and I rarely switched out of this even when I was home. For those who don't want Canary recording all the time, Privacy mode is perfect, but you'll have to remember to go into the app and switch modes often. Much like my experience with the Nest Cam, I often forgot to switch from one mode to the next, resulting in random alerts to my phone when I entered my apartment and face-palms when I realized I had been out all day and didn't set Canary to Armed. But even if you are similarly forgetful, you can change Canary's modes at any time, from anywhere in the app. I also appreciated that alerts were sent to my phone almost every 10 minutes\u2014an improvement from Nest Cam's 30-minute frequency.\n\nWhile there's no two-way audio in Canary like there is in the Nest Cam, it does have a manual alarm you can trigger from the app while you watch live video. It's a 90+ dB beep that plays until you disable it\u2014when I tested it from inside my apartment, I immediately shut it off because it was a louder, more aggressive sound than even my smoke alarm. If you're ever in the situation where your Canary senses a disturbance and you see a thief on your live feed, the alarm could be enough to scare the thief off or, at the very least, startle them. If you'd rather not be so conspicuous about it, you can call your emergency contacts from the live video feed as well.\n\nA peculiar extra feature of the Canary is HomeHealth. This makes use of the device's temperature, humidity and air quality sensors to tell you more about the state of your home. Temperature and humidity are fairly self explanatory, and knowing these measurements could help you adjust rooms in your home for children or pets that are sensitive either factors.\n\nCanary's air quality sensors scans the air for pollutants including carbon monoxide, cigarette smoke, cooking odors, hydrogen, and methane. The air quality chart spiked a bit when I was cooking dinner, so it's sensitive enough to detect pretty minor differences. While this sensor will in no way replace something like a carbon monoxide detector, it is a cool way of knowing what might be going on in your home's ecosystem that you would be otherwise blind to."}

{"78": "Sprint's struggle to compete against Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and T-Mobile US could be your gain.\n\nThe fourth-place mobile carrier is giving big discounts to customers who switch from the top three carriers. From this Friday until January 7, 2016, customers who switch to Sprint will get prices 50 percent lower than rate plans offered by the carrier they're switching from.\n\nFor example, customers switching from Verizon would choose from a separate rate card that has the same data allotments as Verizon, but at half the cost. Ditto for customers switching from AT&T or T-Mobile\u2014under this deal, you have to choose from a rate card specific to the carrier you're switching from. One notable exception is that Sprint isn't offering a half-off version of T-Mobile's $95-per-month unlimited high-speed data plan, though Sprint already offers unlimited data for $70 a month.\n\nThere are some downsides, as Sprint said it will not match the other carriers' offers for data rollover. Sprint also isn't matching T-Mobile's unlimited music and video, but pointed out that it isn't restricting video quality like T-Mobile is.\n\nSprint's announcement said the half-off plans also don't include tethering, but Sprint told us that this is a mistake and that customers will be able to use their phones as mobile hotspots while drawing data from their allotments.\n\nHere's a look at the prices, which will be available online, over the phone, and in Sprint stores:\n\nSprint Sprint prices for Verizon customers. Sprint Sprint prices for Verizon customers. Sprint Sprint prices for AT&T and Cricket customers. Sprint Sprint prices for T-Mobile and MetroPCS customers.\n\nCustomers can port between 1 and 10 lines and lock in the 50 percent pricing until January 8, 2018. Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure used the word \"contract\" to describe the two-year price guarantee in a call with reporters today, but a Sprint spokesperson told Ars that customers don't have to sign a contract to get the 50 percent off pricing.\n\nCustomers would be responsible for the cost of any device they get through Sprint if they end a service plan before paying the device off, but Sprint says the discount pricing is also available to customers who bring their own compatible device. If this works as we expect, the deal will be relatively risk-free for customers who are not under contract with their current carrier and can switch to Sprint using their current phone.\n\nThe fine print says an additional $25-per-month charge will apply when customers get subsidized phones instead of paying the full cost of the device.\n\nCustomers who switch from T-Mobile will continue to get unlimited 2G-speed data after they use their high-speed data allotments. Verizon and AT&T instead use hard caps with overage charges, and customers switching from those carriers will pay overages of \u00a21.5 per megabyte while on the Sprint network.\n\nThis is similar to a deal Sprint offered last year, but in that case Sprint required customers to get a new phone in order to get the special pricing, cutting typical savings down to about 20 percent.\n\nClaure said the new promotion is simpler than last year's and that he believes a lot of customers will choose to get more data instead of taking the full 50 percent discount.\n\nCustomers who don't bring their own phones can acquire a new device from Sprint through the carrier's various payment plans. Sprint is also reimbursing switching fees of up to $650 per line with an American Express Reward Card, but the reimbursement is only available for customers who turn in their current phone.\n\nSwitchers who aren't satisfied with Sprint service have 28 days to change their minds and return their new Sprint devices without paying a restocking fee. There's still a $36-per-line activation fee, which can only be refunded if customers return the device within three days of activation, and customers who leave early would be responsible for service charges for the time they use the Sprint network. Further Reading Sprint to skip spectrum auction in possible blow to wireless competition T-Mobile still plans to challenge AT&T and Verizon for broadcast TV airwaves.\n\nAlthough the 50 percent off switching prices aren't available to existing customers, Sprint has one offer for its current users. If they sign a new two-year contract, they'll get a free Alcatel Pixi 7 tablet with a year's worth of 1GB-per-month service.\n\nThe main thing keeping customers away from Sprint is the carrier's network quality. Although Sprint is too cash-strapped to participate in a major spectrum auction, it says it has used \"cell site optimization, and our targeted deployment of LTE Advanced features like carrier aggregation and beamforming\" to boost network speed and quality.\n\nClaure said Sprint wants to do \"something special to celebrate\" the network improvements, hence the 50 percent discounts. Sprint aims to offer service good enough that customers will want to stay after the 50 percent discounts run out.\n\n\"After two years, the customer will have to make a choice,\" Claure said."}

The long-winged aircraft look something like prehistoric creatures, too, measuring just a stubby 21 meters long compared to an overly broad 37.5-meter wingspan. It had been four decades since as many as three of the great, superannuated birds soared together.\n\nBut then they did. One by one, the WB-57s slowly rolled down the runway at Ellington Airport and then began a slow climb upward into resplendent clear, blue skies. They flew again, thanks to a restoration program by NASA to bring a third WB-57 back from its boneyard. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a day,\u201d Charlie Mallini, who manages the WB-57 program for NASA, told Ars.\n\nSince 1972 NASA has flown WB-57s as part of a broad ranging science mission. Recently two of the aircraft flew high above hurricanes Joaquin and Patricia, major storms in the eastern Pacific Ocean. They have also flown missions as varied as collecting cosmic dust samples from comets and asteroids in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere, investigating clouds and studying the environmental effect of plumes from the Titan, Space Shuttle, Delta, Atlas and Athena rockets on the stratosphere.\n\nThe B-57 line of aircraft dates back to 1944, when the English Electric Company began developing the plane. After the Royal Air Force showcased the B-57 in 1951 by crossing the Atlantic in a record 4 hours and 40 minutes, and becoming the first jet-powered aircraft to span the Atlantic without refuelling, the United States Air Force began buying them to replace its aging Douglas B-26 Invader.\n\nThe aircraft performed bombing missions in Vietnam and other military campaigns, and a variant that later became the WB-57 was designed with longer wings that could fly even higher, up to 62,000 feet. This proved useful for weather reconnaissance and, around the world, to sample the upper atmosphere for evidence of nuclear debris where US officials suspected the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.\n\nEric Berger Before a high-altitude flight the pilot, left, and sensor officer must don their pressure suits. Here's a look at how the process goes. Eric Berger Before a high-altitude flight the pilot, left, and sensor officer must don their pressure suits. Here's a look at how the process goes. Eric Berger The suits come in 12 different sizes and then are modified further to fit each crew person. Eric Berger NASA, and the Air Force, are big on checklists. This emergency checklist is conveniently located in case the crew have to eject from the aircraft. Eric Berger Best to make sure the helmet has a tight seal. Eric Berger The suits need to be fully inflated to test their integrity. Eric Berger Always good advice when you're working with pure oxygen. Eric Berger When fully inflated the pressure suits are rigid, like an overfilled balloon. Only these suits don't pop. Eric Berger How do you eat in a pressurized suit? Through a tube. After six hours of flying, 10 cups of coffee's worth of caffeine in a tube comes in handy. Eric Berger Don't worry. If you don't like caffeinated chocolate pudding, there are a bunch of other flavors.\n\nAs the Air Force began phasing out the planes in the early 1970s, NASA was interested in using them for its programs to study Earth. NASA acquired its first WB-57 in 1972, which was retired in 1982. It later obtained two more, which have continued flying until today. Then, in 2013, NASA found a third WB-57 in the \u201cboneyard\u201d at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona. After two years of restoration, it returned to flying status. This plane, now known as NASA 927, set a record\u2014more than four decades\u2014for the time between its mothballing and return to flight. For some replacement parts, Mallini said, NASA had to go to museums.\n\nFinally, last week, all three aircraft were ready to fly in tandem around the city of Houston, not at 62,000 feet, but at a much lower altitude so they could buzz the space center, downtown and the Astrodome. Under clear skies they put on a spectacular show. After the fun, science missions resume next week.\n\nListing image by Eric Berger"}

{"83": "T-Mobile US today unveiled \u201cBinge On,\u201d a feature that will automatically reduce the quality of video while allowing many video services to stream without counting against customers\u2019 high-speed data limits.\n\nThe carrier said that videos will be capped at \u201cDVD or better quality,\u201d meaning they will generally be downgraded to 480p. Customers who want to stream at normal resolution and don\u2019t mind using their data can turn the feature off. Binge On will be available to new Simple Choice customers beginning Sunday and will be extended to existing T-Mobile customers starting Thursday, November 19. Further Reading Unlike AT&T, T-Mobile isn\u2019t charging companies to circumvent data caps Still, T-Mobile favors big content providers with unlimited music streaming.\n\nBinge On will be automatically enabled. Customers who want to shut it off must do so in their account settings at my.t-mobile.com. On family plans, Binge On can be disabled on a per-user basis if you want it enabled for some users but not others.\n\nThey key benefit of Binge On is that 24 video services, including Netflix, HBO, and Hulu, will stream without counting against data limits. But the video compression apparently applies to video regardless of whether it's from one of the services that are exempt from caps.\n\n\"Powered by new technology built in to T-Mobile\u2019s network, Binge On optimizes video for mobile screens, minimizing data consumption while still delivering DVD or better quality (e.g. 480p or better),\" the company said. \"That means more reliable streaming for services that stream free with Binge On, and for almost all other video [emphasis ours] it means T-Mobile Simple Choice customers can watch up to three times more video from their data plan.\"\n\nBased on the above and similar statements in a T-Mobile FAQ, it appears that nearly all video will be compressed unless customers shut the service off. With the service on, many videos won't count against caps, while others will count against the caps but won't use as much data as they normally would.\n\n\"If customers have Binge On turned on and use another service that isn\u2019t included for free, it will still be optimized and will allow them to use up to 3X as much data (so it would count against the allotment, but will be optimized),\" T-Mobile told Ars today.\n\nAs the FAQ notes, \"Every Simple Choice customer can watch 3 times more video with your data plan with Binge On enabled.... You can always choose to turn off Binge On, however, you will no longer have the ability to stream for free from your favorite streaming services or have video optimized for your smartphone screen resulting in higher usage of your high speed data.\"\n\nServices that won't count against data caps are Netflix, HBO Now, HBO Go, Hulu, Sling TV, Sling Box, ESPN, Showtime, Starz, Movieplex, Encore, Vevo, Vessel, Univision Deportes, Major League Baseball, Fox Sports, Fox Sports Go, NBC Sports, Crackle, Vudu, and Ustream. It'll work either in the providers' apps, or in mobile Web browsers.\n\nThe carrier\u2019s own T-Mobile TV is also exempted, as are videos from T-Mobile\u2019s rivals, namely Verizon\u2019s Go90 and AT&T\u2019s DirecTV.\n\nNotably absent is Google\u2019s YouTube. Google participates in T-Mobile\u2019s similar Music Freedom program, which exempts data from many music streaming services. We\u2019ve asked Google whether it plans to join Binge On and will provide an update if we get one.\n\nT-Mobile says it's \u201cnot a net neutrality problem\u201d\n\nMusic Freedom was criticized by some net neutrality advocates, who argue that Internet providers can influence what content consumers access by picking and choosing what counts against data caps.\n\nBut so-called \u201czero-rating\u201d services aren\u2019t outlawed by the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s net neutrality rules. The rules allow for complaints against zero-rating schemes, with the commission judging on a case-by-case basis whether a practice \"unreasonably interferes\" with the ability of consumers to reach content or the ability of content providers to reach consumers.\n\n\u201cThis is not a net neutrality problem,\u201d T-Mobile US CEO John Legere said during today\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s free, the providers don\u2019t pay, the customers don't pay. Most importantly\u2026 you can shut it off, it\u2019s complete customer choice.\u201d\n\nBinge On uses a \u201cproprietary\u201d system to optimize video streams, Legere said. \u201cThis is open to any service that wants to come,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone that can meet our technical criteria, we will include.\u201d T-Mobile will also take nominations from customers, just as it did with Music Freedom.\n\nConsumer advocacy group Public Knowledge is concerned about Binge On. Instead of the carrier choosing which services don't count against caps, T-Mobile \"could put the choice of which services to zero-rate in customers' hands, not its own, or explore ways to allow customers to freely stream lower-quality media regardless of its source,\" Senior Staff Attorney John Bergmayer said. \"Under its current model, customers might choose to use a service simply because it doesn't count towards their data plans, rather on its merits.\"\n\nT-Mobile posted a comparison video to show what its optimized streams look like compared to full HD quality.\n\nBinge On does not work outside the US. When streaming over Wi-Fi or domestic roaming, video resolution \"defaults to the highest available,\" T-Mobile says.\n\nDoubling data allotments\n\nInstead of having hard data caps, T-Mobile\u2019s Simple Choice plans provide a limited amount of high-speed data and then throttle customers after they use it up. Customers who use up the allotment and any rolled over data can either purchase additional high-speed data or make do with slower speeds for the remainder of the billing cycle. Video and other data is throttled to 2G speeds once customers go through their allotments, T-Mobile told Ars. (There appears to be an exception for music.)\n\nAlso today, T-Mobile increased the amount of high-speed data in many plans. Simple Choice plans that offer 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB of high-speed data (for $50, $60, or $70 a month) will all be doubled to 2GB, 6GB, and 10GB, the carrier said. Family and business plans get the doubled data at no extra charge, T-Mobile said, while pricing for individual plans is altered a bit. The new plans will be available starting Sunday.\n\nThe 2GB plan is not eligible for Binge On's video data exemption, though it still gets the compression that can reduce video data usage. The free streaming is only for plans that have at least 3GB of data.\n\nThe unlimited plan for individuals will remain at $80 but will include 14GB of mobile hotspot data, as opposed to the current 7GB. (UPDATE: The unlimited data price is actually going up to $95.) Optimized videos from the 24 Binge On services won\u2019t count against the mobile hotspot allotment. Unlimited customers can claim a free movie rental from Vudu each month beginning in January, but only if they leave the Binge On optimization feature on.\n\nOne downside of the new Simple Choice plans is that Data Stash\u2014which lets you roll unused data over to future months for up to a year\u2014is capped at 20GB. Previous plans did not place any limits on how much data a customer could collect in Data Stash."}
{"84": "\"We're going to do some laps, but this isn't a track car. If I hear anyone complaining about brake fade or lap times I'm not going to be happy.\" So went the pep talk from Audi leading up to our time with the company's new TT. And while we got several laps\u2014at the Circuit of the Americas no less, before the Lone Star Le Mans races\u2014there are few things we'd rather do with a new car than get to know it on a world-class circuit. The prospect of our first track time this year only came in second on our list of \"reasons we want to drive the new Audi TT.\" Rather, we were really excited to try out the car's UI, which the company calls \"Virtual Cockpit.\"\n\nReplacing all a car's dials and gauges with a single TFT screen isn't new, but the TT is the first car we've driven to start really pushing the idea. It works in conjunction with Audi's MMI infotainment system\u2014which is really quite good now\u2014letting you do cool things like displaying Google Maps full-screen with overlays for important info from the car. Ambitious UI experiments don't always succeed, but after several hundred miles the TT's clever dash thoroughly impressed us. Oh, and the rest of the car wasn't too bad either. Like the nice man from Audi said, it's not a track car. Style takes priority over speed, but that's no bad thing if done properly.\n\nLooking good has always been the TT's reason for being. It first appeared in 1995 as a concept car, wowing the crowds at that year's Frankfurt auto show. Three years later the Mk 1 TT went into production, keeping almost all of the concept's good looks. Underneath it made good use of Volkswagen Group's parts bin, something that's always left the car (and the subsequent Mk 2) with accusations of being a \"Golf in drag.\" These days those kinds of insults are somewhat meaningless. Sure, both TT and Golf use VW's Modularer Querbaukasten (MQB) platform, but so do eight other cars; that's the entire point of developing MQB. This chassis is a mix of steel for the bits that undergo the most stress and extruded aluminium. The body panels are also mostly aluminium, too, which has helped make the third generation TT 110 lbs (50kg) lighter than the outgoing car.\n\nElle Cayabyab Gitlin The third-generation TT adds some R8-inspired menace to the classic TT shape. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The third-generation TT adds some R8-inspired menace to the classic TT shape. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The iconic aluminum fuel filler door is present and correct. You just push it down and it springs open, and there's no filler cap underneath to worry about. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin This will be slightly subjective, but we adore the styling of the interior. Everything you touch feels well-made, whether it's plastic or machined aluminum. Audi Vents with integrated controls for the air conditioning. Highly reminiscent of a Nest thermostat in our opinion. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin On track at the Circuit of the Americas. The cockpit ergonomics are good, although there are reports that very tall or wide drivers might not love it.\n\nThe exterior styling is an evolution of the first TT's design, now featuring more hard angles. It's literally an edgy interpretation of the classic TT, although there are a few R8 styling cues here and there as well. Signature TT design touches are present and correct: the aluminium fuel filler door, the double-bubble silhouette, the large clamshell hood, and fastback rear hatch. The original TT did without a spoiler at first, requiring a recall to fit one (following costly lawsuits) after early owners found that aerodynamic shape generated lift over the rear at speed. Here, there's a retractable spoiler that rises at speed, which does the car's appearance many favors. Overall, it is, to our eyes, an extremely attractive car to look at; not a bad thing in this market segment.\n\nInside, things are even better. We've said this before, so at the risk of sounding like a stuck record, there really is no volume car maker better at interiors than Audi right now. Again, this was evident back with the original TT and its famous baseball glove seats. You sit low in the car, hugged well by the leather seats (with a frightening amount of electric adjustment). Large turbine-shaped air vents stud the dashboard. Each has a small LCD display at its centre, a bit like a Nest thermostat. There are a few toggle switches on the dash (for changing the driving mode, turning on the hazard lights, and turning off the parking sensors and traction control), but almost everything else is handled either with the MMI jogwheel or its mirrored controls on the multifunction steering wheel.\n\nSpecs at a glance: 2016 Audi TT Coupe Body type 2-door coupe Layout Front engine, all wheel drive Powerplant 2L turbocharged direct injection inline 4. Transmission Six-speed S-Tronic Dual Clutch Automatic Horsepower 220 bhp @ 4,500-6,200 rpm Torque 258 lb-ft @ 1,600-4,400 rpm Steering Variable ratio electromechanical power steering Suspension Weight-saving MacPherson strut front suspension, four-link rear suspension. Tires Front/Rear: 245/35 R19 Top speed 130mph/209km/h Fuel economy 46.3mpg Weight 1,445kg (3,186lb) Wheelbase 2,505mm (98.6in) Dimensions 4,184mm (164.7in) x 1,832mm (72.1in) x 1,353mm (53.2in) (LWH) Base price \u00a327,150 Price as tested ~\u00a335,000 Options added Scuba Blue metallic paint, Technology Package, 19\" wheel package, S Sport seat package, Bang and Olufsen Sound System\n\nThat jogwheel and the gearstick both emerge from the centre console, which is topped in a lovely machined aluminium finish. The metal finish is used as a highlight to good effect throughout the interior. It's a dark cabin but doesn't feel gloomy. There's decent room for both driver and front seat passenger, but the rear seats are for occasional use only. That's not to suggest it isn't a practical car; it's merely a practical car for two. The trunk has lots of room even with the back seats up, and folded down one ought to be able to fit bicycles or other large unwieldy things in the back.\n\nUp front is a 2L TSFI engine, which means gasoline, a turbocharger, and direct injection. Power and torque\u2014220hp (162kW) and 258lb-ft (350nM)\u2014gets sent to all four wheels via a six-speed dual clutch gearbox. In fact, the TT is constantly reading the coefficient of traction at all four wheels (Audi tells us it does this 150 times every 10 milliseconds) as well as the steering angle and yaw rate, altering the torque sent front-to-rear via an electronically controlled (Haldex) clutch between the front wheels via light applications of the brake (this is also how the ESC system works). It will even send all of the available power to the front or rear wheels should conditions demand.\n\nYou can choose between different driving modes with a toggle switch on the dash; Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, and Individual. Dynamic sharpens the throttle response, weights up the steering, stiffens the suspension, and sends the majority of the power to the rear wheels. You also get some quiet (but lovely) pops and parps from the exhaust when shifting up through the gears in Dynamic, even if the engine is otherwise rather aurally anonymous. Comfort takes things the other way as well as telling the gearbox to freewheel when you're not on the accelerator for better fuel efficiency. Individual\u2014as you might guess\u2014lets you pick and choose different settings for each of these, so you can have a soft comfy ride but sportier engine noise and rearward-biased power delivery, for example.\n\nOverall, performance is adequate. If you're looking for a coupe to take to the track or go canyon carving, Porsche's Cayman might be a better choice. Zero to 60mph takes about 5.5 seconds, and the car tops out at 130mph (209km/h). But that's not to say the TT is dull to drive. The dual clutch gearbox (S-tronic in Audispeak) feels a little slow to kick down in automatic, so you'll want to use the paddles on the steering wheel when making progress. Handling is reminiscent of a Golf GTI, which is no bad thing. Audi was kind enough to arrange for some hot laps at the Circuit of the Americas (COTA to its friends) the morning of the big races, which gave us a chance to push the car in a way we wouldn't on public roads.\n\nElle Cayabyab Gitlin The offer of a few hot laps of a current F1 circuit are usually enough reason to pay for the airfare, and we thoroughly enjoyed driving the TT at COTA. But that was still only the second coolest thing about the TT. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The offer of a few hot laps of a current F1 circuit are usually enough reason to pay for the airfare, and we thoroughly enjoyed driving the TT at COTA. But that was still only the second coolest thing about the TT. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin That honor belongs to the Virtual Cockpit. If you look closely, you'll see we're on one of the circuit roads, heading to the track for our laps. Audi Drive Select allows you to tweak the settings for all these different systems. The way you can tune and adjust cars on the fly thanks to electronics is one of our favorite things about modern cars. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin You can switch between Comfort, Auto, Dynamic, and Individual. We'll let you guess where \"Leadfoot\" Gitlin spent most of his time... Audi A diagram showing how the car vectors torque between front and rear axles, and from side to side. Elle Cayabyab Gitlin The aftermath of our four hot laps. There was a huge amount of rubber pickup from the track, and much of it was still there two days and 250 miles later. We apologize to whoever got the job of cleaning the tires.\n\nCOTA has a marvelous complex of decreasing radius corners, which the TT handled capably, the same going for the track's wonderful sweeping turn 19. We also got near the car's top speed on the long back straight. Unfortunately, by the third lap the TT's tires had picked up enormous quantities of rubber from the track, a consequence of so many different races (and tire compounds) that weekend. Large chunks of tire pickup were being flung at us from the TT in front, and things started to get very understeery. Discretion being the better part of valour, we backed off and cruised around for the remainder of our hot lap session before handing the track over to a parade of more than 100 Porsches.\n\nThat tire pickup stayed with the car for the rest of our weekend, making the drive back to Dallas somewhat less relaxing than it could have been, thanks to the vibration from having not-completely round wheels. (Ah, the joys of press fleet cars; some other poor bugger gets the job of cleaning them afterwards. We should note that at Ars, we do our very best not to abuse press cars and always try to give them back with at least half a tank of gas.)\n\nArtificial washboard effect aside, the TT was extremely effective on the freeways of Texas. The Lone Star state has an admirable approach to highway speed limits, and the TT ate the miles from Austin to Dallas. Active lane assist is available, but sadly there's no adaptive cruise control. This is a real pity; the one-two combination of these systems takes much of the fatigue out of long road trips in so-equipped cars.\n\nListing image by Elle Cayabyab Gitlin"}

{"86": "With just a wee prick and a few drips, researchers hope to one day test for a wide range of ailments. Such low-pain, low-drain blood diagnostics would mean doctors could ditch big needles and vein-hunting, making patient care more pleasant. And those mini blood tests could offer easy, non-invasive testing alternatives in resource-poor healthcare settings, such as clinics in developing countries.\n\nBut making that diagnostic dream into a clinical reality may be bloody challenging, new data suggests.\n\nTiny blood droplets that leak successively from a pricked finger can have widely variable contents, researchers reported in the American Journal of Clinical Pathology. In some cases, test results on such finger-bled droplets had nearly eight times more variation than vein-harvested blood samples\u2014the gold standard. Only when the authors tested upwards of five drops combined (60 to 100 microliters) were they able to get accurate results. The study raises concerns that new diagnostic tests that rely on blood drops may yield inaccurate results.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big push right now, especially for low-resources settings, to develop tests that can be done with very tiny sample volumes,\u201d senior author Rebecca Richards-Kortum, a bioengineer at Rice University, told Ars. \u201cThe main message that I hope people take away,\u201d she said, \u201cis that you shouldn\u2019t just assume that you can reduce that volume without looking first to see: does it vary from drop to drop?\u201d\n\nAmong the many medical companies pushing for such low-volume technology, Theranos Inc. has arguably made the biggest splash. The now-beleaguered startup and its high-profile founder, Elizabeth Holmes, touted technology that could perform clinical tests with just a few drops of blood, offering a menu of more than 200 tests, ranging from cholesterol to anemia. But the company has been plagued by criticism after a Wall Street Journal article called into question the accuracy of those tests. The article cited former employees who said the company wasn\u2019t relying on its own technology due to problems.\n\nWhether drop-to-drop variation is part of those problems is unclear. The company has yet to publish data on the accuracy of its tests (though Holmes announced that it plans to).\n\nTheranos declined to comment for this story.\n\nThe swing is the thing\n\nThe company has so far only received FDA approval on one of its prick-based blood tests. But that test may be a best-case scenario, William Clarke, a clinical chemist at Johns Hopkins University, told Ars. The test detects a herpes infection, which is a yes-or-no, present-or-absent kind of test\u2014not a test with the possibility of big swings, Clarke said.\n\nSwings were the problem in the study led by Richards-Kortum. She and her colleague Meaghan Bond drew blood from 11 healthy donors and used successive finger droplets for a handful of tests, including ones that measured hemoglobin and white blood cells. At first, the researchers thought maybe their equipment was off. But after testing the samples further, diluting them into larger volumes of liquid and comparing results with venous samples as controls, the researchers found that the droplets themselves varied.\n\nThe results are not shocking, Clarke said. The study only looked at relatively big, cell-based blood components, he noted, which may drain out differently depending on blood flow. And, he noted, some other tests using blood drops, such as glucose, have been worked out and are accurate. But, he added, the study offers a good reminder that diagnostic developers need to be careful.\n\nEach blood component, from cholesterol to iron, might have its own drop-to-drop variation and minimum accurate volume, he said. And that variability could be different in each patient population. For instance, if Richards-Kortum\u2019s study swapped healthy blood donors for people with poor blood flow, such as those with heart failure, the measured droplet variability might have been very different.\n\nStill, variability might not make a diagnostic test useless, Clarke noted. Any test or sample method will have variability, it\u2019s just a matter of how much and if a health professional can still use the results to make the right call.\n\nThe key here is to just be very aware of the quality and the limits of each test, he said.\n\nAmerican Journal of Clinical Pathology, 2015.

{"89": "Further Reading Meet John Tye: the kinder, gentler, and by-the-book whistleblower \u201cWe\u2019ve taken significant steps down the road towards a surveillance state.\" Though it was revealed by Edward Snowden in June 2013, the National Security Agency's (NSA) infamous secret program to domestically collect Americans\u2019 e-mail metadata in bulk technically ended in December 2011. Or so we thought. A new document obtained through a lawsuit filed by The New York Times confirms that this program effectively continued under the authority of different government programs with less scrutiny from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).\n\nThe bulk electronic communications metadata program was initially authorized by the government under the Pen Register and Trap and Trace (PRTT) provision, also known as Section 402 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Times\u2019 document, a previously-top secret National Security Agency Inspector General (NSA IG) report from January 2007, contains a lot of intelligence jargon but crucially notes: \"Other authorities can satisfy certain foreign intelligence requirements that the PRTT program was designed to meet.\"\n\nWhile such a theory had been pushed previously by some national security watchers, including Marcy Wheeler, this admission had yet to be officially confirmed. Wheeler argued that not only do the post-PRTT programs achieve the same goal, but she believed they were in fact more expansive than what was previously allowed.\n\nThe bulk metadata program, which began in secret under authorization from the FISC in 2004, allowed the NSA to collect all domestic e-mail metadata including to, from, date, and time. When this program was revealed by the Snowden leaks in The Guardian, the government said that the PRTT program had been shut down 18 months earlier for \"operational and resource reasons.\"\n\nIt was believed that the FISC imposed a number of restrictions on the PRTT program, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) itself.\n\nThe databases could be queried using an identifier such as an email address only when an analyst had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that the email address was associated with certain specified foreign terrorist organizations that were the subject of FBI counterterrorism investigations. The basis for that suspicion had to be documented in writing and approved by a limited number of designated approving officials identified in the Court\u2019s Order. Moreover, if an identifier was reasonably believed to be used by a United States person, NSA\u2019s Office of General Counsel would also review the determination to ensure that the suspected association was not based solely on First Amendment-protected activities.\n\nFurther Reading The executive order that led to mass spying, as told by NSA alumni Feds call it \u201ctwelve triple three\u201d; whistleblower says it's the heart of the problem. The PRTT program was designed to help the intelligence community intercept and analyze \"one-end foreign\" communication\u2014in other words, people in the US communicating with people outside the US.\n\nEO 12333 strikes again\n\nThe newly public document cites two legal authorities that govern foreign data collection: Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act and the Special Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis (SPCMA), which sits under Executive Order (EO) 12333.\n\nSection 702 largely governs content collection wholly outside the United States (it\u2019s what PRISM falls under). Meanwhile, EO 12333, which ex-government officials (including Snowden himself) have complained about, is a broad Reagan-era authority that allows data collection on Americans even when Americans aren't specifically targeted. Without this executive order, such actions would be forbidden under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978.\n\nEO 12333 specifically allows the intelligence community to \"collect, retain, or disseminate information concerning United States persons\" if that information is \"obtained in the course of a lawful foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, international narcotics, or international terrorism investigation.\"'\n\nAccording to John Tye, a former State Department official who spoke with Ars in August 2014, EO 12333 has the potential to be abused as it could \"incidentally\" collect foreign-held data on Americans. \"12333 is used to target foreigners abroad, and collection happens outside the US,\" he told Ars. \"My complaint is not that they\u2019re using it to target Americans, my complaint is that the volume of incidental collection on US persons is unconstitutional.\"\n\nTye continued:\n\nThere are networks of servers all over the world and there have been news stories on Google and Yahoo\u2014the minute the data leaves US soil it can be collected under 12333. That\u2019s true not just for Google and Yahoo, that\u2019s true for Facebook, Apple iMessages, Skype, Dropbox, and Snapchat. Most likely that data is stored at some point outside US or transits outside the US. Pretty much every significant service that Americans use, at some point it transits outside the US. Hypothetically, under 12333 the NSA could target a single foreigner abroad. And hypothetically if, while targeting that single person, they happened to collect every single Gmail and every single Facebook message on the company servers not just from the one person who is the target, but from everyone\u2014then the NSA could keep and use the data from those three billion other people. That\u2019s called 'incidental collection.' I will not confirm or deny that that is happening, but there is nothing in 12333 to prevent that from happening.\n\nUPDATE Saturday 12:55pm ET: Tye also e-mailed Friday evening, adding:"}

Instead, the company will offer hospitals up to 50 percent discounts and will make other adjustments to help patients afford Daraprim, a drug used to treat a parasitic infection and often given to HIV patients.\n\n\"We pledge that no patient needing Daraprim will ever be denied access,\" Nancy Retzlaff, Turing's Chief Commercial Officer, said in a news release. She added that \"drug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug's list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the company said that it planned to modestly reduce prices amid intense backlash from the public and health experts over the initial price hike. However, at the time, the company and its CEO, Martin Shkreli, were mum about exactly how much the price would go down.\n\nWith the price standing, Turing will offer additional money-saving measures such as new, smaller bottles with only 30 tablets, helping to reduce the costs for hospitals to stock the medicine.

{"91": "As part of a set of defense decisions that British Prime Minister David Cameron described as delighting President Barack Obama, the British government announced plans to purchase nine P-8 Poseidon long-range patrol planes from Boeing through a foreign military sale approved by the US government. The Poseidon, the aircraft built by Boeing to replace the US Navy's aging Lockheed P-3 Orion antisubmarine warfare patrol aircraft, will fill the gap left by the retirement of the Royal Air Force's Hawker Sidley Nimrod fleet over four years ago, and the cancellation of the UK's own follow-on aircraft. It means about $1.5 billion more in business for Boeing and its partners; the Poseidon currently has a \"flyaway\" cost of $171.5 million per aircraft.\n\nThe P-8 is based on the Boeing's 737-800 with modified wings and a strengthened fuselage. The plane's main sensor is its AM/APY-10 multifunction radar, a high-resolution radar that can be used both over sea and land for surveillance of surface targets, and as a weather radar. It has a bomb bay that can be used for dropping torpedoes as glide bombs from an altitude of up to 30,000 feet, and it can carry SLAM-ER standoff land-attack missiles, Harpoon anti-ship missiles, and an assortment of other missiles, mines, torpedoes and bombs in addition to its sonobouy air-dropped acoustic sensors. A modified version is already flown by the Indian Navy.\n\nThe Poseidon purchase is part of a larger effort to increase the size and capability of the RAF and the rest of the UK's military\u2014a \u00a312 billion ($18.1 billion) increase in the nation's defense budget and part of a \u00a3178 billion ($270 billion) program over the next 10 years put forward in the government's five-year National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review, which Cameron presented to the House of Commons today. The programs planned will also extend the life of the RAF's Eurofigher Typhoon fighters, adding two additional Typhoon squadrons (for a total of seven) and keeping the planes in service until 2040. The UK will also buy an additional squadron of F-35 fighters for the Royal Navy beyond the UK's original commitment.\n\nFurther Reading UK will speed up purchase of F-35 jets, increase anti-terror budget by 30% ... but will also announce huge budget cuts for other departments on Wednesday.\n\nThe Poseidon aircraft will be based out of Scotland and will be used for maritime patrol \"to protect our nuclear deterrent, hunt down hostile submarines, and enhance our maritime search and rescue,\" according to the security review document. The Poseidons could also be used over land for electronic surveillance and intelligence collection, target tracking, and search-and-rescue missions.\n\nThe increased budget proposed by Cameron is part of a NATO commitment to raise defense spending to two percent of gross domestic product. The UK has the second largest defense budget in NATO, trailing only the US.\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica"}
{"92": "DICE and EA don't have a good track record when it comes to multiplayer releases\u2014see the likes of the disastrous launch of Battlefield 4. But Star Wars Battlefront, while not exactly the game many were hoping for, at least seemed to work fairly well, with none of the severe server issues that dogged BF4.\n\nUnfortunately for EA, Battlefront is suffering from a different kind of problem: that of the immortal player. According to report from Ars sister publication Wired UK, immortal players have been causing grief in the game's multiplayer modes. Wired UK played several multiplayer matches earlier this week, and saw at least two instances of players who were impervious to all weapons and melee attacks. Those players racked up 100 kills each in a mere 10-minute round.\n\nThe appearance of immortal players has lead to accusations of deliberate cheating on social media and Reddit. However, with most of the reports of immortal players coming in from the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game, it makes it highly unlikely that any deliberate hacks have been deployed. Instead, players on Reddit are claiming they inadvertently became immortal after crashing a ship, with others saying it just happened randomly.\n\nFurther Reading Star Wars: Battlefront review: Stunning as the Death Star, dry as Tatooine The licensed nostalgia of this simplified shooter wears off after just a few rounds.\n\nIn the past, players who were found to be deliberately making use of bugs and exploits in multiplayer matches have been banned from games, although this practice has been known to affect innocent players too. Other bannable glitches have included the wonderful Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Javelin glitch, which made players explode when they were shot, and World of Warcraft's Corrupted Blood incident, which resulted in a virtual plague that wiped out whole cities until the bug was fixed a week later.\n\nWhile Battlefront's immortal bug appears to still be affecting players\u2014at least if YouTube is anything to go by\u2014it's likely DICE will come up with a fix for this doozie of a glitch before too long, particularly as the game launches today in the UK.\n\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK"}

In addition to hitting ProtonMail, the attackers also took down the datacenter housing our servers and attacked several upstream ISPs, causing serious damage.\"\n\nFurther Reading Crypto e-mail service pays $6,000 ransom, gets taken out by DDoS anyway Follow-on attacks show capabilities \"commonly possessed by state-sponsored actors.\" Tuesday's update still maintains that there were two waves of attacks carried out by two separate groups. The first attack, the post said, was executed by the Armada Collective, a group that performs distributed denial-of-service attacks on selected targets and then demands a ransom of thousands of dollars to get the assaults to stop. As Ars reported last week, ProtonMail was roundly criticized by many security professionals for paying the group $6,000 in bitcoins, only to come under a much more powerful attack in the following days.\n\nThe second round of attacks were much more extensive. For reasons not made public, ProtonMail officials said they were sponsored by a wealthy nation-state. Getting back online required the technical assistance of several services, including networking experts from IP-Max, service provider Level 3 Communications, and Radware, a DDoS-mitigation service. Even now, the attacks are continuing, but they're no longer capable of knocking ProtonMail offline for long periods of time. In Tuesday's post, ProtonMail officials wrote:\n\nProtonMail was attacked by at least two separate groups. The first attacker, the Armada Collective, demanded a ransom, more on this can be found in the previous posts copied below. The Armada Collective has contacted us to deny responsibility for the second attack. The second group caused the vast majority of the damage, including the downing of the datacenter and crippling of upstream ISPs, exhibiting capabilities more commonly possessed by state-sponsored actors. They never contacted us or made any ransom demands. Their sole objective was to take ProtonMail offline, at any cost, with no regards for collateral damage, and to keep us offline for as long as possible. They have still not been identified. It was not until the 3rd day of attack that we realised there were two separate attackers. Given the sophistication of the attack used by the second group, we believe they may have been preparing their attack against us for some time. After seeing the first attack, they chose to strike immediately afterwards in the hopes that they would not be discovered as being a separate attacker. If there are DDoS experts interested in reviewing the attack data, we welcome them to contact us at security@protonmail.ch\n\nThere was no explicit mention this time that the group responsible for the second wave was sponsored by a nation-state.\n\nTuesday's update came a few weeks after the Swiss Governmental Computer Emergency Response Team warned of the recent arrival of the Armada collective.\n\n\"The Armada Collective blackmails their victim, demanding 10 BTC (Bitcoins), which is around 2,500 (Swiss Francs) [or about $2,480 at the exchange rates at the time],\" CERT officials wrote in an advisory last updated on October 22. \"At the same time, the hackers launch a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) against the victim's website to demonstrate their power. This demo DDoS attack usually last for 15min-30min, while the bandwidth varies from around 300Mbit/s to 15GBit/s and occasionally even more. The attackers threats [sic] their victim that in case of non-paying, they will launch another, even bigger DDoS attack to bring the victims website down.\"\n\nWhile much is known about the Armada Collective and an earlier DDoS-for-ransom group called DD4BC, little is known about the second attack gang that ProtonMail said hit it. Speculation about the group's motives run the gamut from blackhats who want to punish companies for paying ransoms to a wealthy nation that wants to shut down ProtonMail's encrypted e-mail service.\n\nProtonMail has promised to release a detailed report on the attacks. It will be worth paying attention to it to see what more can be learned."}
{"94": "Several UK media outlets\u2014including the Daily Mail, The Mirror, and The Telegraph\u2014have claimed that Sony's PlayStation 4 is being used by ISIS/ISIL/Daesh to plan its attacks, with The Express even saying that a PS4 was used to plot the recent horrifying attacks on Paris.\n\nHowever, as uncovered by Eurogamer, the sourcing and reporting for these stories is extremely suspect. Most are based on comments from Belgium's deputy prime minister, Jan Jambon, which came from a debate on ISIS's use of online recruitment. The debate was held three days before Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris.\n\n\"PlayStation 4 is even more difficult to keep track of than WhatsApp,\" he said. \"It's very, very difficult for our services\u2014not only Belgian services but international services\u2014to decrypt the communication that is done via PlayStation 4.\"\n\nJambon is most likely referring to the PS4's Party Chat feature, which allows players to exchange voice and text messages one-to-one or in a group, and is indeed encrypted. However, there's no evidence that the feature is actually being used by terrorists, let alone that it played an integral part in the Paris attacks.\n\nThe mainstream UK media has linked Jambon's comments with the Paris attacks by way of an International Business Times article, which claimed that a PS4 was discovered in raids in Belgium following the attacks. However, this remains unconfirmed by the authorities. Notably, a quick read of the IBT article\u2014which contains the line \"ISIL could convey an attack plan in Super Mario Maker's coins and share it privately with another PS4 user\"\u2014would raise suspicions about the validity of the report.\n\nThe IBT article itself was based on another article on Forbes, which now features a large correction at the top saying: \"It has not been confirmed, as originally written, that a console was found as a result of specific Belgian terror raids. Minister Jambon was speaking about tactics he knows ISIS to be using generally.\"\n\nThat these two reports led to the publication of headlines like \"ISIS terrorists used Sony PlayStation 4 to plot Paris massacre\" (The Express) is at best misinformed, at worst purposefully sensationalist. That headline has since been changed to \"Did ISIS terrorists use a PlayStation 4 to plot Paris massacre in the streets?\"\n\nAs Eurogamer helpfully highlighted, \"[none of the stories] pointed out the likelihood that a PS4, a console that has sold just shy of 30m units, would be found at a home in Belgium occupied by a person in their twenties.\"\n\nSony has since issued a statement, which reads:\n\n\"PlayStation 4 allows for communication amongst friends and fellow gamers and, in common with all modern connected devices, this has the potential to be abused. However, we take our responsibilities to protect our users extremely seriously and we urge our users and partners to report activities that may be offensive, suspicious or illegal. When we identify or are notified of such conduct, we are committed to taking appropriate actions in conjunction with the appropriate authorities and will continue to do so.\"\n\nFurther Reading ISIS using encrypted apps for communications; former intel officials blame Snowden [Updated] Former CIA director claims Snowden \"has blood on his hands\" for tipping off terrorists.\n\nAs the world tries to come to grips with the atrocities that took place in Paris at the weekend, questions are being asked about how such attacks could ever have taken place. Yesterday, it emerged that several former intelligence officials and media analysts were blaming NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden for revealing intelligence agencies' surveillance capabilities. The comments came following evidence that the attackers from Syria were using encrypted communications.\n\nAs we noted in the report, terrorist organisations have been using encryption of various sorts for more than 15 years at least\u2014way before Snowden's whistleblowing.

{"95": "On Sunday, The New York Times reported that the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will be expanding its tests on diesel passenger vehicles, including on-road testing in addition to lab tests.\n\nFurther Reading VW software emissions scandal widens to include Porsche [Updated] Up to 800,000 additional vehicles are affected. The changes come on the heels of a massive scandal involving Volkswagen Group diesel cars, which were found to have included \u201cdefeat devices\u201d that prevented the cars\u2019 emissions control systems from working on the road but allowed the system to kick in when the cars were being tested for emissions compliance in a lab.\n\nIn the US, lab tests on new cars are ordered by auto manufacturers and sent to the EPA for vehicle certification. The EPA can randomly check those lab tests with on-road tests or more lab tests, but Volkswagen was able to circumvent the EPA\u2019s emissions regulations for years without being caught. Defeat devices aren\u2019t new either\u2014since the '70s auto manufacturers (including Volkswagen) have been caught building mechanical and digital work-arounds to pass regulators\u2019 tests while allowing the car to spew pollutants during real-world use.\n\nLast week, the EPA said that in addition to the more than 480,000 diesel Audis and Volkswagens that it originally found with defeat device software, additional 2014, 2015, and 2016 diesel Audis and Porsches were found to pollute more dramatically on the road than their lab tests promised.\n\nChristopher Grundler, director of the office of transportation and air quality at the Environmental Protection Agency, told the Times that the new on-road tests will be included in the diesel vehicle certification process to help the EPA screen for lab tests whose numbers have been goosed by defeat devices. \u201cManufacturers have asked us what the test conditions would be, and we\u2019ve told them that they don\u2019t have a need to know,\u201d Grundler said. The EPA did not return Ars\u2019 request for comment.\n\nEurope is also planning on instituting on-road testing by 2017. However, auto manufacturers will still be able to modify their cars and use pre-production vehicles, as well as conduct their own tests.\n\nVolkswagen has tried to stem the bleeding from the massive scandal that has decimated its stock and called into question the status of at least 11 million cars worldwide that the company says have defeat device software on them. Volkswagen Group says that it has submitted plans to recall and fix many of the affected vehicles by January in the EU and pending EPA approval in the US.\n\nUntil then, Volkswagen Group today announced that it will give $500 to owners of Volkswagens that were initially cited in the EPA\u2019s first Notice of Violation in mid-September. Those car owners will also get another $500 gift card to be spent at VW or Audi dealerships, as well as three years of free roadside assistance, CNNMoney says.\n\nThat package will cost Volkswagen $250 million, but that\u2019s only a fraction of what the car company will have to spend in recalling its problem vehicles and paying fines to regulatory agencies it deceived."}
{"96": "Federal prosecutors forcefully responded to Apple\u2019s court filing in a New York drug case this week, saying that the company should help the government extract data from a seized iOS 7 iPhone pursuant to a warrant just as it has in the past. Officials from the Department of Justice have now asked a judge to compel Apple to assist the government in unlocking the phone in question, an iPhone 5S.\n\nAs Robert Capers, a United States Attorney based in Brooklyn, wrote:\n\nAbsent Apple\u2019s assistance, the government cannot access that evidence without risking its destruction. But Apple can. Indeed, Apple has repeatedly assisted law enforcement officers in federal criminal cases by extracting data from passcode-locked iPhones pursuant to court orders. Apple has acknowledged that it has the technical capability to do so again in this case.\n\nCapers went on to say Apple\u2019s arguments about \"tarnishing the Apple brand\" after complying with federal law enforcement are \"without basis as a matter of law,\" and he noted Apple's objection this time seems novel. \"The government is not aware of any prior instance in which Apple objected to such an order,\" he concluded. Further Reading Faced with an iPhone they can\u2019t unlock, cops again turn to Apple for help Cupertino says no. Plus, issue is nearly moot on more secure iOS 8 devices.\n\nThe government\u2019s filing revealed the exact nature of the case in question for the first time\u2014it's a felony drug charge brought against a man named Jun Feng, who is also known as \"Kevin.\" Feng\u2019s phone is an iPhone 5S that the government needs help unlocking. Feng is one of seven defendants in the case, and he was charged with three counts of possessing and distributing methamphetamine. His trial is currently scheduled for November 2015.\n\nIn the filing, prosecutors stated that \"someone sent an erase command to the Target Phone after the government seized the phone. Had the phone obtained a network connection while agents examined it, that erase command could have resulted in the data on the phone becoming permanently inaccessible.\"\n\nThe government also made a rather novel legal argument, claiming that because the iOS software itself is sold under a license rather than a true sale, Apple therefore maintains a controlling interest and is required to help. However, some civil libertarians argue that not only is that a creative line of reasoning, but Apple is perfectly within its rights to refuse to aid the feds.\n\n\"Apple's decision to prioritize customers security is a valid one,\" Esha Bhandari, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, told Ars. \"Just because a company has voluntarily complied with law enforcement in the past doesn't mean it\u2019s obligated to do so in the future. Offering encrypted devices is lawful and companies are entitled to prioritize their customers and their security.\"\n\nConscripting lock manufacturers?\n\nFor its part, Apple says that the government cannot use the 18th-century law known as the All Writs Act to conscript the company\u2019s assistance. At its core, this federal law simply allows courts to issue a writ, or order, which compels a person or company to do something. In the past, feds have used it to compel unnamed smartphone manufacturers to bypass security measures for phones involved in legal cases. The government has previously tried using this same legal justification against Apple as well. Further Reading Apple CEO Tim Cook blasts encryption backdoors \"It\u2019s in everyone's best interest that everybody is blocked out,\" Cook said.\n\n\"The government\u2019s proffered reading of the All Writs Act, if carried to its logical conclusion, leads to disquieting results,\" Ken Dreifach, an attorney representing Apple, wrote in his reply to the government on Friday.\n\n\"For example, if the government wanted to crack a safe, it could require the safe\u2019s manufacturer to take possession of, or even travel to the location of, that safe and open it. If the government wanted to examine a car, it could send the car to the manufacturer and require the manufacturer to perform the examination. The government could seemingly co-opt any private company it wanted to provide services in support of law enforcement activity, as long as the underlying activity was authorized by a warrant. The All Writs Act does not confer such limitless authority.\"\n\nDreifach also noted the fact that Apple has helped during previous \"data extraction demands\" should have no bearing on what it does in this case. The attorney stated those orders and warrants were obtained through a one-sided (ex parte) process that Apple was not officially party to.\n\nAs he continued:\n\nIn order to better protect its customers, Apple has offered language for law enforcement to use in search warrants, but has never taken any position on whether All Writs Act orders in aid of search warrants are legally appropriate, because it has never been a party to such proceeding. Where it received orders, Apple examined the orders for technical feasibility and burden, but as a non-participant in an ex parte process, Apple did not challenge the underlying authority of the court to issue the orders, nor has it challenged the determination of probable cause contained in the warrants. The present situation is very different. There is no outstanding order and the Court has raised sua sponte the question of its authority to issue such an order pursuant to the All Writs Act and has specifically asked Apple to provide its view to the Court.\n\nBoth Apple and the feds are set to appear before the judge on Monday, October 26 in a hearing that was postponed from Thursday, October 22. But this particular point of contention arose more than a year ago when Apple introduced full encryption by default on devices that have iOS 8 or later installed. At the time, the company specifically said the move happened \"so it's not technically feasible for us to respond to government warrants for the extraction of this data from devices in their possession running iOS 8.\" Further Reading Apple expands data encryption under iOS 8, making handover to cops moot \"Apple cannot bypass your passcode and therefore cannot access this data.\"\n\nThis week, Apple even extended this pro-privacy stance to the 10 percent of devices still running iOS 7. So regardless of the outcome in the Feng case, Apple's new encryption practices could have larger implications for other tech companies that do not have the legal firepower or willpower to resist government surveillance to the same degree.\n\n\"In other words, [the feds] may win this battle over this phone, but they are losing war because the systems of smartphones are switching to technology that Apple and other companies cannot decrypt the phones,\" Brian Owsley, a former magistrate judge and current law professor at the University of North Texas, told Ars in an e-mail. \"It is only a matter of time before almost all phones have a system that cannot be decrypted.\""}
